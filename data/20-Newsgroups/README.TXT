The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

Organization
The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware / comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale / soc.religion.christian). Here is a list of the 20 newsgroups, partitioned (more or less) according to subject matter:

comp.graphics
comp.os.ms-windows.misc
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
comp.sys.mac.hardware
comp.windows.x	rec.autos
rec.motorcycles
rec.sport.baseball
rec.sport.hockey	sci.crypt
sci.electronics
sci.med
sci.space
misc.forsale	talk.politics.misc
talk.politics.guns
talk.politics.mideast	talk.religion.misc
alt.atheism
soc.religion.christian
