This movie introduces its heroine on what looks like her deathbed, as she gives someone behind the camera instructions for her funeral. But the nearly 90 minutes that follow might convince a viewer that Julita Salmerón, whose son, the Spanish actor Gustavo Salmerón, directed this frank and affectionate portrait, will live forever.

In the next scene, Julita sits at a kitchen table and her son is heard offscreen saying he doesn’t know how to “start this documentary.” Julita counters with her own misgivings about being the subject of “this documentary.” Both are being at least a tiny bit disingenuous. Gustavo Salmerón is a longtime moviemaking professional (although this is his first time directing a feature), and Julita appears to be an old hand at playing to the camera. The movie’s title derives from what Julita says she wanted from life before she got married. She carries the air of someone who gets what she wants, and in short order we learn that after marrying she had six children.
