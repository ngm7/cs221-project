Peter Masterson, who co-wrote and co-directed the bawdy hit Broadway musical “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” and later directed “The Trip to Bountiful” from a screenplay by Horton Foote, a distant cousin, died on Tuesday at his home in Kinderhook, N.Y. He was 84.

The actress Mary Stuart Masterson, his daughter, confirmed the death. He had received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease 14 years ago.

Mr. Masterson had played various movie, television and stage roles when he read an article by Larry L. King in a 1974 issue of Playboy magazine about the shuttering of the Chicken Ranch bordello in Texas. When Mr. Masterson called Mr. King to suggest that the article had the makings of a musical, Mr. King laughed.

“It seemed as incongruous as if someone had asked me to assist in open-heart surgery,” Mr. King wrote in The New York Times in 1978.
