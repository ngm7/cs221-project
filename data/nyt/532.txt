Brenda C. Snipes, the elections supervisor of Broward County, Fla., whose department has endured blistering criticism for mistakes during the recount in three statewide races in November, has withdrawn her plans to step down after the governor suspended her on Friday.

The reversal over the weekend by Dr. Snipes, an elected Democrat, came hours after Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican who is now the state’s senator-elect, signed an executive order that stripped her of her position, placed her on leave without pay and appointed one of his former political aides as her replacement. It was among a series of salvos between the public figures in recent days, as Mr. Scott declared that Dr. Snipes must be removed because she had “demonstrated malfeasance, incompetence and neglect of duty.”

The governor cited a litany of mistakes by her department in recent elections, including its failure to meet the state’s deadline to submit results of a machine recount of ballots cast in the midterm elections in November. One of the races subjected to a recount included Mr. Scott, who narrowly defeated Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent.

“After a series of inexcusable actions, it’s clear that there needs to be an immediate change in Broward County,” Mr. Scott said on Friday evening in a statement, “and taxpayers should no longer be burdened by paying a salary for a Supervisor of Elections who has already announced resignation.”
