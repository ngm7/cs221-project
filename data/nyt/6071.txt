STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. — Tara Geraghty-Moats was 11 the first time she took a big trip for a ski competition. Her mother insisted she was still too young to travel with a team, so the pair set off from Vermont, boarded a plane and flew to Steamboat Springs for the 2005 ski jumping and Nordic combined Junior Olympics.

She was so excited at the opportunity to compete in a national Nordic combined event that she had personal-best days on both sides of the sport: cross-country skiing, where she finished the five-kilometer race so quickly that she did not beat her time again until she was 18, and ski jumping, where she summoned the courage to fly from one of the complex’s big jumps for the first time.

“I didn’t even know enough to be scared,” she said. “That was such an awesome week.”

Nearly 14 years later, again in Steamboat Springs, Geraghty-Moats struggled to stay upright after yet another big breakthrough. She planted her ski poles in the snow and leaned into them before looking up with a wide, bright grin on a dark, cold night. Emotions swirled, joy and relief mixing at the finish line for the first senior international women’s Nordic combined competition ever contested on North American snow.
