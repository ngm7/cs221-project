Edwin Diaz was at home in his native Puerto Rico last week when buzz about a potential blockbuster trade that would send him and his Seattle Mariners’ teammate, Robinson Cano, to the Mets fluttered across social media. By Friday, the trade was in mostly in place. That night, Cano, who was in his native Dominican Republic, called Diaz.

“Be ready,” Cano told Diaz. “We’re going to New York. We’re going to have fun over there, win games and help the team.”

On Monday, Cano, a second baseman, and Diaz, a relief pitcher, were in New York for their physicals and dinner with the Mets’ brass, including the owners, front office staff and Manager Mickey Callaway. The next morning, the players were formally introduced as the Mets’ new stars — completing a splashy, albeit risky, move that signaled the team’s commitment to contending for a playoff spot in 2019 after back-to-back losing seasons.
