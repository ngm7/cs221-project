Christmas week is a strange time in the hospital.

There’s an added melancholy for patients who spend the holidays hospitalized — a sense that their illness, whatever it might be, is so bad they must lie in bed while the world hangs ornaments and roasts chestnuts on open fires. It’s a time when the doctors and nurses on call start to feel the weight of jobs that too often keep them close to computers and far from their families.

And yet, a certain camaraderie emerges, an extra measure of meaning and gratitude growing from the recognition that we’re all there together. Santa hats emerge. Ugly sweaters replace white coats. Candy canes flow freely.

I remember caring for one patient, a retired college professor who was having trouble breathing, during this strange holiday time. His lungs had slowly scarred over, and now, only small patches performed their basic functions. He could barely walk to the bathroom without gasping for air. His speech grew staccato, short sentences punctuated by deep breaths.

His adult son, who hadn’t seen him in years, had flown across the country to take an oral history of his life. Each morning when I stopped in to check on him I had to interrupt their recording sessions, hearing the son ask: What did you love most about Mom? Did you really like your job? What were you most proud of?
