Channing Dungey, who left ABC only a month ago as its entertainment head, is taking a high-ranking executive position at Netflix, the streaming company announced on Monday.

Ms. Dungey, who was the first black executive to run an entertainment division at a major network, will become a vice president of original content, Netflix said. She will report to Cindy Holland, who has been with the company for 16 years and is also a vice president for original content.

This is the third time in a year and a half that Netflix has hired a veteran of ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company. Shonda Rhimes, the creator of the ABC hits “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” is now overseeing a broad slate of original programming that may hit the service next year. Kenya Barris, the creator of “Black-ish,” also recently signed a deal with Netflix after his relationship with ABC soured.

Netflix said Ms. Dungey will oversee “a large and crucial portion” of its original content, including the company’s deals with several successful showrunners. In her new role, Ms. Dungey will be reunited with Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Barris, as well as overseeing other major producers like Jenji Kohan (“Orange Is the New Black,” “Glow”) and Marti Noxon (“UnREAL,” “Sharp Objects”) who have deals with Netflix. Netflix said Ms. Dungey will help oversee programming that will be made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions production company.
