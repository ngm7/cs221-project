The book’s cover features a striking image, from his “Black-and-White Type 55 Polaroid Street Portraits” series, of a young black girl with a knife-shaped nose ring, staring directly into Mr. Bey’s lens. Framing his subjects with subtlety, he concentrates on people others take for granted.

“All of those Street Portraits were about giving the black subjects an affirmative space in which to present themselves to the camera and to the world,” he said. “The subjects in those photographs all direct their gaze toward the camera, and by extension the viewer. I wanted the respect that I had for each of them to be the thing that the viewer was also left with.”

Mr. Bey returned to Harlem in 2014 to photograph a city in the throes of gentrification for his “Harlem Redux” series. As Harlem's physical and social landscape changed drastically, Mr. Bey’s images offer a meditation on the loss of cultural memory, place and identity. It was his first sustained project that was not portrait based, using a more conceptual visual language. Amid a backdrop of increased tourism, the erasure of community and the demolition of landmarks, Mr. Bey documented the privatization of public space through steel gates and fences, exploring the notion of areas that were shared, but off-limits.

“Although these structures are abstract, they have real implications for black life,” Leigh Raiford, an associate professor of African-American Studies at University of California, Berkeley, said. “We need Bey’s work to make sense of a major historical transition that other cities are also experiencing. How do you render that absence and loss? How do you image a system? What does a picture of white supremacy look like? In ‘Harlem Redux,’ you can only see through a cutout, a gate or a veil. There’s a sense that there is something that keeps you from moving.”
