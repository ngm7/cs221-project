Dance: Mark Morris’s ‘The Hard Nut’ in Brooklyn

Through Dec. 23, bam.org.

Dances turn into classics for a reason. And in Mark Morris’s “The Hard Nut,” returning to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, there are plenty of them, from the pop-art designs inspired by the cartoonist Charles Burns to the yule log burning on a television set during the party scene. Morris bases his version of holiday classic on E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.” It’s both a riot and a poignant tale of a young girl’s awakening.

For the treasured Mark Morris Dance Group, it also reunites past generations. John Heginbotham, as Mrs. Stahlbaum/Queen, and June Omura, as Fritz, reprise longtime roles, while the veteran company member Laurent Grant returns to the part of Marie. (It’s her 22nd year.) And “The Hard Nut” wouldn’t be the same without the presence of Morris himself. As Dr. Stahlbaum and the King, he’s nothing short of divine. GIA KOURLAS
