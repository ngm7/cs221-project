A former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee was sentenced on Thursday to two months in prison for lying to federal law enforcement agents about unauthorized contact he had with an unidentified reporter during a federal leak investigation.

The former aide, James A. Wolfe, 58, pleaded guilty in October to one count of making a false statement to the F.B.I. during an interview last December, when he denied that he had been in contact with reporters whose work was the focus of the leak probe.

His prison sentence will be followed by four months of supervised release, during which he must complete 20 hours of community service per month, said Bill Miller, a spokesman for the United States Attorneyâ€™s Office for the District of Columbia.

The judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson of United States District Court, also ordered him to pay a $7,500 fine, according to the spokesman. The government agreed to dismiss two additional charges of making false statements as part of the plea deal to which Mr. Wolfe agreed in October.
