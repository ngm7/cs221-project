I’d like to knock out some waffles this weekend. Maybe some scones as well. Serve those alongside glazed bacon and someone’ll ask if you’re thinking of opening a bed-and-breakfast.

A roast beef po’ boy would be a fine thing to eat on Sunday, for lunch if you can start cooking early enough, or for dinner as the Patriots-Steelers game spools out on CBS. And if you can manage to get some French fries on it, and a spray of cheese, that would be amazing. That kind of meal not for you? Try Alison’s recipe for brown-butter salmon with lemon and harissa instead.

This would be a good weekend to build a gingerbread house. And maybe to make gingerbread rum balls when you’ve finished.

Or you could make black cake, top it with extra rum, wrap it tightly in wax paper and foil, and allow it to mature until Christmas Day. (Need a soundtrack for that? Nitty Gritty, “We Three Kings.”)
