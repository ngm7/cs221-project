Kathleen Ughetta and Andrew Wood met on a set of monkey bars at Lafayette Avenue Elementary School in Chatham, and their relationship was set in motion when he asked to hold her hand at their school’s fifth-grade roller-skating party. Later that school year during one very memorable recess, they shared a first kiss.

“It was on a dare from one of our classmates,” Ms. Ughetta said with a laugh.

When asked who had kissed the other first, Ms. Ughetta, laughing much harder, said, “I think it was a tie.”

They dated throughout high school and continued as an item through most of their time together at North Carolina, but in their last semester as seniors, their relationship “hit a serious rough patch,” as Ms. Ughetta put it.

They graduated from North Carolina in May 2015, but rather than going separate ways, they got into Mr. Wood’s Subaru two months later and drove 10,000 miles, from the Jersey Shore to the California coast and back, camping and hiking at close to 20 national parks and forests.
