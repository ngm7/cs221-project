There is an industrial stretch of 37th Street in Long Island City, Queens, just off Queens Boulevard where you can walk and suddenly be hit with the most incongruous of odors: the pungent, earthy smell of truffles.

You have arrived at the nondescript warehouse of Regalis Foods, which sells fine truffles and other expensive wild foods.

Inside, the truffle smell is more intense and the work pace is on full holiday bustle.

“The week before New Year’s is our busiest of the year,” said the owner, Ian Purkayastha, 26, who started Regalis at age 19 with a cooler in a beat-up minivan. He now supplies many of the finest restaurants in Manhattan — including Eleven Madison Park and Le Bernardin — which are typically packed for New Year’s Eve.

It also happens to be the tail end of white truffle season and the beginning of black truffle season in Europe, both products that Mr. Purkayastha has become a go-to supplier for among the city’s top chefs.
