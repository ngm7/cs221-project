Watch out, New Yorkers: There’s a new ape in town. Well, in Brooklyn, anyway.

And though this outer borough hominid isn’t 20 feet tall like the one currently terrorizing Broadway, he does (we are told) “play Ping-Pong with his ding-dong.”

That’s a ditty you’re simply not going to hear in the musical. Indeed, Lisa Clair’s play “The Making of King Kong,” which opened on Sunday at the Doxsee in Sunset Park, is basically the bizarro-world inverse of that $35 million extravaganza. For one thing, it cost $35,000 to produce.

But imagination comes at many price points, and Ms. Clair, a recent graduate of Brooklyn College’s playwriting program, isn’t interested in spectacle for its own sake. Her jungle (designed by Caitlin Ayer) consists of some potted plants and green lights (by Samuel Chan). Instead of a whole ape, she makes do with just a few fingers of one furry hand — big enough for the heroine to nestle in comfortably.

Some of her other ideas aren’t as comfortable, and that’s really the point of this satirical if scattershot take on the tale. All of the gender and racial ickiness of the 1933 film — defused or simply erased in the Broadway retelling — is here brought to the fore.
