NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through Dec. 30). Where better to spend the week of Christmas than in the Land of Sweets? City Ballet’s annual monthlong presentation of “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker” is well underway, and the coming week brings another parade of the company’s talented principals and soloists trading off in myriad roles, including the regal Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier. In addition to the expected marvels, like that massive telescoping Christmas tree, there are subtle recent changes as well, notably in Act II, the long-ingrained cultural stereotypes of which the company has toned down.

THE RADIO CITY ROCKETTES at Radio City Music Hall (through Jan. 6). Along with the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, the Rockettes’s “Christmas Spectacular” is one of New York’s most colorful and popular holiday traditions. An army of beaming beauties in candy-cane colors participate in eight dance numbers that range from tap dancing to that famous razor-sharp kick line and other merry scenes of highly synchronized prancing. In a new ending this year, the dancers get aerial reinforcement from a unit of blinking drones.

VICKY SIMEGIATOS DANCE COMPANY at the St. George Theater (Dec. 23, 1 and 6 p.m.). A few nights before Christmas, another “Nutcracker” will stir in the city. This one comes from Simegiatos, a Greek dancer who came to New York to train with American Ballet Theater before opening her own dance school and starting a company. Her troupe’s annual presentation of “The Nutcracker” is notable for its stellar guest artists; this year, they are the elegant New York City Ballet principals Teresa Reichlen and Ask la Cour.
