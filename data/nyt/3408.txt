After Chicago’s collapse against Green Bay in Week 1, Eddie Jackson called his teammates lazy and complacent. He said they did not finish.

In the fourth quarter of Sunday’s grudge match between the longtime rivals, Jackson, a standout safety, picked off an Aaron Rodgers pass in the red zone, effectively shutting down the Packers’ comeback attempt and giving the Bears a 24-17 victory at home that clinched the N.F.C. North title.

That Jackson limped off the field following the play, heading to the locker room shortly afterward with a sprained ankle, could portend bad things for Chicago going forward, but on this day he lived up to his promise to make sure his team did not fall apart again. In doing so he ended Rodgers’s streak without an interception at 402 passes, an N.F.L. record.

“We talked about finishing all week — ‘finish finish finish,’ ” Coach Matt Nagy said at his postgame news conference. “We had a very similar situation as we did the first week, and we were able to finish the game.”
