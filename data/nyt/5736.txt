Both men had difficult relationships with women, which are alluded to, but not explored in any complexity, though Nina Arianda makes a meal out of a snack, playing the formidable Russian wife of Laurel, perpetually skeptical of the comics’ promoter, Bernard Delfont (a wonderfully oily Rufus Jones).

But the focus here never strays far from the prickly friendship at its center. There are a few knowing jokes, such as when Laurel and Hardy push a trunk up stairs, in an echo of their famous comic bit from “The Music Box,” in which they move a piano, but this time, when it slips out of their hands, Hardy just stares at the fallen object at the bottom of the stairs and says: “Do we really need that trunk?”

Such nods to their comic triumphs are few, and as the cracks in their relationship begin to show, the movie builds to a major blowup between the two in a party scene when they exhume old grievances and fight like bitter siblings. Laurel says he did all the creative work and was repaid by a lack of loyalty, while Hardy cuts even deeper, calling his longtime partner a hollow man fueled by jealousy for Charlie Chaplin. When Laurel angrily tosses a piece of food at Hardy’s head, the crowd observing this dispute mistake it for a bit, laughing and shouting, “Bravo!” It’s a funny and dark moment, one that comedians would understand.

But this movie is not a dark portrait of the expectations of a fickle audience. This loud dispute is necessary for the reconciliation that follows, one that tips over into sentimentality. Most movies about comedians present them as harsh and brooding collectors of neuroses, but Coogan and Reilly even at their most contentious present Laurel and Hardy as gentle, flawed figures.
