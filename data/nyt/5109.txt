Staying in for Christmas? Watch a feel-good holiday classic. Or stream a Marvel film or two.

What’s on TV

A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983) 6 p.m. on TBS and 7 p.m. on TNT; also on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. The annual marathon of this Christmas classic wraps up. Peter Billingsley plays Ralphie, a 9-year-old in 1940s Indiana who aches for a Red Ryder air rifle for Christmas but is constantly being warned by adults that he’ll shoot his eye out. The movie may be a holiday favorite today, but it didn’t impress The New York Times critic Vincent Canby when it opened. “There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in ‘A Christmas Story,’” he wrote in his review. “But you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.”

WHEN CALLS THE HEART: THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS BLESSING (2018) 8 p.m. on Hallmark. This Christmas special picks up where Season 5 of the Canadian drama series, based on novels by Janette Oke, left off. (Spoilers ahead!) While the newly widowed Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) focuses on welcoming her new baby, Abigail (Lori Loughlin) prepares for Hope Valley’s Christmas gathering and the town greets unexpected guests.
