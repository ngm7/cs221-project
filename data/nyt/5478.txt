BEIJING — A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced a former top security official to life in prison, the latest high-profile figure to fall in President Xi Jinping’s anticorruption campaign.

The official, Ma Jian, 62, a former vice minister of the Ministry of State Security, was convicted of taking $15.9 million in bribes, committing insider trading and using coercive business practices, the Dalian Intermediate People’s Court said in a statement on its website.

But it was another part of Mr. Ma’s past that had drawn attention lately: his ties to Guo Wengui, the billionaire Chinese fugitive who has unleashed a barrage of embarrassing accusations against Communist Party leaders from his New York penthouse.

The court said that from 2008 to 2014, Mr. Ma colluded with Mr. Guo, a real estate tycoon who was among China’s richest men, using threats to force sales that benefited Mr. Guo’s businesses. Mr. Guo fled China in 2015.
