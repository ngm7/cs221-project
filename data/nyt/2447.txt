Although it may prove to offer temporary relief for selected individuals, the effectiveness of ketamine remains an open research question. Promotion in the media as a breakthrough therapy is premature and likely to foster unregulated prescribing and profiteering by some professionals and industry.

To the Editor:

My son suffered from chronic pain, depression and thoughts of suicide for 15 years, until his psychiatrist researched and recommended ketamine as a treatment. He started off with five infusions over a period of a week, and then followed up with an additional infusion once every five or six weeks after that.

I would often sit with him during the treatment, and we would talk from time to time during or immediately after the infusion â€” about a hallucination, or how close he got to solving the problems of the world. But he was always perfectly fine about half an hour after the treatment, when I would assist him to a cab to take him home.

He knew immediately after his very first treatment that the infusion was working, and continued to feel better thereafter. Controlling the depression allowed him to focus on controlling his pain, where he made progress as well.
