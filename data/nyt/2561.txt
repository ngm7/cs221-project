Bill Cosby’s lawyers made plain this week the basis on which they are seeking to challenge his conviction for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, an appeals process that could take as long as a year as the parties submit legal briefs to the Pennsylvania Superior Court.

None of the 11 issues raised in papers filed Tuesday in Montgomery County Court are new to those who have been following the case, but they set the parameters of where the defense feels it has the strongest possibility of overturning Mr. Cosby’s conviction.

The papers challenge the way the trial judge, Steven T. O’Neill, handled various parts of the case and range from the assertion that he wrongly ignored the testimony by a former district attorney who said he had promised never to prosecute Mr. Cosby to the argument that he erred by allowing testimony from five other women who had accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them.

Mr. Cosby, 81, was convicted in April and sentenced in September to three to 10 years in state prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Ms. Constand, in his home outside Philadelphia in 2004.
