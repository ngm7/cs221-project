Re “In Abrupt Shift, Trump Halves Size of U.S. Force in Afghanistan” (front page, Dec. 21):

Will leaving Afghanistan put more innocent children in harm’s way?

A friend in Afghanistan sent me a photo of a young boy who reportedly was a casualty of a suicide bombing on Christmas Eve. In his small hands was money to buy bread for his family. Meat is a luxury for many Afghan families, so bread is an important food source, and young children are often sent out to buy the daily bread. This child never made it to the bread shop that tragic day; he never made it back home either.

The photo reminded me of the image of Alan Kurdi, a 2-year-old Syrian refugee whose body lay on a Turkish beach after he drowned trying to reach safety. Or 7-year-old Amal Hussain, whose horrific photo showed her starving to death in war-ravaged Yemen. This Afghan child was yet another young life lost in a seemingly never-ending conflict.

For children in the United States, bombs are not a daily threat that puts them in harm’s way. But in war-torn Afghanistan, children are sadly caught in the crossfire.

We have a responsibility as human beings to protect the most vulnerable and fragile lives among us — including a poor little boy just trying to buy bread for his family.
