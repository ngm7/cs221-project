To the Editor:

Bret Stephens has done it again (column, Dec. 1)!

One would never stereotype various ethnic Americans. Why does Mr. Stephens continue to malign poodles?

He seems not ever to have shared his home with a poodle. Poodles are very intelligent, caring dogs. They are excellent judges of character. They are not indiscriminately obedient. No self-respecting poodle would ever lie down in Vladimir Putin’s lap. And to compare Donald Trump to a poodle? I don’t think so.

We were lucky enough to enjoy Ko-Ko for 16 years. He was a standard poodle and a therapy dog, and he excelled at obedience trials, where he had to think out various maneuvers, not blindly follow commands.

He was housebroken in two days, never chewed anything except the piano bench when he was a pup. He taught our other dogs canine manners: He was a true leader.
