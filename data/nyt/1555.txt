The Women’s World Cup draw is Saturday in France, only a week after New Zealand thumped Fiji to claim the final place in the tournament. That means the United States, one of the tournament favorites; the host, France; and the rest of the 24-team field will find out their opponents for the group stage and the cities where those games will take place. Here’s a primer before the balls are pulled out of the pots.

When and Where Is the Draw?

The draw is Saturday at the Seine Musicale in Paris (6 p.m. local time, noon Eastern). It will be broadcast live in the United States on Fox Sports 2 and Telemundo.

How Does the Draw Work?

The procedure for the Women’s World Cup mirrors the one for FIFA’s men’s quadrennial championship. In the women’s draw, the 24 teams that have qualified have been grouped into four pots determined by their world rankings.
