The tumult that arises from many people of many nations trying to build a city together has subsided for the moment. It is the beginning of the second act of the thrilling drama “The Jungle,” which opened on Sunday at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, and it feels as if all the world is holding its breath.

Everyone on and off the stage — and the boundaries between the two are unnervingly porous in this immersive London-born production — is focused on the 17-year-old Sudanese boy, newly bruised and bleeding, with the ugly lattice of scars on his bared torso. His name is Okot, and he is about to enumerate the times he died — and no, he doesn’t say “almost died” — during his journey, thousands of miles across desert and ocean, to this migrant camp in Calais, France.

Portrayed by John Pfumojena with a concentrated stillness that absorbs light and sound, Okot asks an older member of the camp, a Syrian, if there is any point in his saying what he is about to say: “If I talk to her, you think she will understand?”
