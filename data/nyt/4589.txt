‘TAPESCAPE’ at Brooklyn Children’s Museum (through Dec. 31). These days, part of your own home might look like an art installation made of tape. This piece, however, promises to be more creative — and more fun. A collaboration between the museum and the artist Eric Lennartson, “TapeScape” consists of 480 rolls (about 15 miles) of clear packing tape woven and wrapped around a metal frame. The result is a one-and-a-half-story structure, illuminated with LED lights, that incorporates not only tunnels and passageways to explore, but also intriguing lessons in geometry and physics.

UP CLOSE FESTIVAL at the New Ohio Theater (Dec. 20-21, 7 p.m.; Dec. 22-24 and Dec. 27, 3 p.m.; through Dec. 31). The urban theorist Jane Jacobs probably didn’t have children’s theater in mind when she wrote “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” but that hasn’t deterred Peter Musante and Summer Shapiro, who have used her community-building ideas — and her affection for Greenwich Village — to develop a festival of short plays for young people. Part of the Theater for Young Minds series, the new Up Close Festival asked a variety of writers and companies to create seven works that invite children 5 and older to do activities like draw, sing and invent poetry as they immerse themselves in dramatizations of New York City history. Divided into two programs — each consists of an interactive preshow and four 10-minute plays — the festival draws on real events like the 1965 blackout, the arrival of Manhattan’s first known immigrant (Juan Rodriguez, in 1613) and, yes, the emergence of that subway rodent known as Pizza Rat.
