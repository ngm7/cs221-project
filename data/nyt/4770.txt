DUBLIN — The Irish government has published a “sobering” contingency plan in case of a no-deal exit by Britain from the European Union, a move that officials say would hurt Ireland more than any other country in the bloc.

The document, published in Dublin on Wednesday, concludes that the Republic of Ireland would have to “focus on crisis management” in the event of an abrupt divorce by Britain, which would “potentially involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts.” Though it has deep economic ties to Britain, Ireland will remain in the European Union.

The plan identifies at least 45 pieces of legislation that would have to be passed by the Irish Parliament to maintain the country’s close relationship to Britain in areas such as security, health, education, border cooperation, tourism and trade. All other parliamentary business may have to be set aside in January to pass these laws, officials said, if London and Brussels cannot agree by then on an orderly Brexit plan.

Irish imports and exports depend heavily on trucks crossing by ferry to and from the Island of Great Britain, which acts as Ireland’s “land bridge” to the rest of the European Union. If, after decades of being in a common market, Britain and the rest of the bloc erect customs and regulatory controls between them, Ireland could suffer severe disruption to supply chains, including vital sources of food and medicine.
