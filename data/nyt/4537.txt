Heydrick Padilla had always been a good student — particularly in math. He figured he would go to college and major in something like business that required numbers. Then he took a chemistry class.

He still remembers his final experiment. “We were given five unknown samples,” he said, “and were tasked with finding out what compounds we were given.” The students had to use techniques they had learned in class to test the samples and identify them.

“That’s where it all changed,” Mr. Padilla said.

He could envision a career in chemistry after two difficult years at the rigorous Bard High School Early College in Manhattan, where the curriculum was demanding and he had lost a friend who fell out of a window and died, forcing him to deal with loss and grief.
