To the Editor:

Migrants have been the lifeblood of the United States. They are the foundation upon which our country was built. We have long recognized our moral and legal obligation to provide asylum to those fleeing persecution.

Current immigration policy contradicts this commitment. The detention of families, separating children from their parents, unfounded suspicion about the good faith of asylum seekers, and the lack of due process all violate our basic values.

I am particularly concerned to see government efforts to weaken due-process rights. Migrants, like everyone in America, deserve determinations of their claims by independent, impartial and fair procedures. Our current immigration procedures do not meet these standards.

The United States must always respect human rights.

Immigrants who come to our borders must be provided a fair procedure. This is exactly what international law and our Constitution require. This is the promise of the values upon which America was built.
