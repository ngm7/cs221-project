“The areas we are not sure about, we’re telling them to continue business as usual,” he added. “If you feel like you want to get tested, get tested. In the meantime, we’re going to continue our overall study to make sure what we’re saying is 100 percent accurate.”

But the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued Newark and the state in June, accusing them of violating federal safe drinking water laws, said the city was downplaying lead levels in neighborhoods, like the East Ward, that were served by the Wanaque. More than a fifth of samples tested at residences served by the Wanaque in the second half of last year yielded levels above five parts per billion.

“To hand wave and say there’s no problem when there are numbers above the federal threshold, and when they haven’t taken a recent hard look at how the corrosion control is working, is inappropriate and deeply concerning,” said Erik Olson, senior director for health and food for the environmental group.

No amount of lead exposure is known be safe for children, whose mental and physical development can be impaired, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

And many experts say that the federal action level of 15 parts per billion, established in 1991, is outdated and fails to take into account new research on the effects of lead exposure.

“It’s based on old, old science,’’ said Dr. Jennifer Lowry, a toxicologist at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, and chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ council on environmental health. “We know so much more now.’’

Today, Dr. Lowry added, “a health-based standard” would “certainly be below five.”

When Newark’s filter distribution began, the city’s website described water in homes in the East Ward as “safe.’’ A week later, the safety reference had disappeared, but language remained stating that residences served by the Wanaque “do not require a filter under this program.”
