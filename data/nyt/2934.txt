Hi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes, coming to you live in the middle of crazy season, with all the partygoing, toasting, gift shopping, cookie baking — the blitz of spangly, year-end exuberance.

When I finally get home, I’m totally beat. I want dinner to just be done, but for it still to be pretty good. (Standards!) So here are some of the best fast recipes I know on NYT Cooking. Not a single one takes longer than 30 minutes, and most are faster than that. If you have freezer reserves, draw on those too. (On Wednesday I heated up turkey meatballs that I’d stockpiled alongside jarred tomato sauce, toast from the freezer and brussels sprouts on the side.) Or order a pizza or enchiladas. Do what you need to do! And as always, I’m at dearemily@nytimes.com.

Here are five dishes for the week:
