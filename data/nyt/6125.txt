BUENOS AIRES — Héctor Timerman, a former Argentine foreign minister who was charged with treason in 2013 for his role in negotiating an agreement with Iran relating to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, died on Sunday at his home here. He was 65.

His lawyer, Graciana Peñafort, said the cause was respiratory failure. Mr. Timerman had been under treatment for liver cancer, she said.

“He was very deteriorated physically, and his heart simply did not tolerate any more,” Ms. Peñafort said.

Mr. Timerman was foreign minister under President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner from 2010 until 2015, the year she left office. His tenure was marked by increasing tension between Argentina and the United States. He had served as Argentina’s ambassador in Washington from 2007 to 2010.
