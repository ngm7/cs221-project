Restitution is coming.

After experiencing years of buffering beach balls, price gouging and righteously rude service in New York State, at least two million customers of Charter Communications, formerly Time Warner Cable, will get sweet revenge, thanks to the New York attorney general, Barbara Underwood.

An investigation found that the company had cheated customers by falsely advertising internet speeds beyond its capability.

In announcing a settlement on Tuesday, the attorney general’s office said it was the largest consumer payout by an internet service provider in United States history: $62.5 million paid directly to customers, with a total market value of $174.2 million.

Within the next three months, more than 700,000 active customers will get a $75 refund, plus their choice of premium cable channels — six free months of Showtime or three free months of HBO. (Game of Thrones is set to start its final season in April.)
