The Park Avenue Armory’s Wade Thompson Drill Hall floor restoration project has received an infusion from New York City.

The Manhattan Borough President, the New York City Council and the city’s Cultural Affairs department announced Friday that they are providing nearly $2 million in funding for the historic building, in a joint effort to help restore its 138-year-old floors.

The combined city capital funding of $1.925 million — $1 million from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office, $875,000 from the City Council and $50,000 from the Manhattan Borough President’s Office — will go toward the Armory’s $4 million floor project, which began last August. It is part of the building’s ongoing $215 million-revitalization effort and aims to replace the current floorboards, of Georgia yellow pine, with wood from various historic buildings around the country, including the Domino Sugar Factory.

Completed in 1881, the Armory’s cavernous 55,000-square-foot drill hall has hosted immersive performances and installations from artists of all disciplines. The Armory also offers arts education programming to students from underserved New York City public schools — which the renovation could help to continue.
