Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

Pop & Rock

ERIC B. & RAKIM at Sony Hall (Dec. 27, 9 p.m.). Rap is unique among musical genres in that most of its founding members are not only alive, but living in the New York metropolitan area. Long Island’s Eric B. & Rakim, one of the genre’s foundational acts, reunited in 2017 after a hiatus from public performance of more than 20 years. Now old-school and young rap fans alike have a chance to see the legendary duo in action, performing hits like the jazzy “Don’t Sweat the Technique” and “I Ain’t No Joke.”

HOLIDAY JOY: A GOSPEL CELEBRATION at the Apollo Theater (Dec. 22, 2 p.m.). CeCe Winans, who has won 12 Grammys over more than three decades in gospel music, will perform selections from the recently released “Something’s Happening! A Christmas Album” at this holiday-centric show. Her sound, which skews toward the polished, grand side of church music, will be balanced by Brooklyn’s own Hezekiah Walker and his Love Fellowship Choir, who favor a more raucous, groove-driven take on gospel. Both Walker and Winans are pastors, so the concert will likely feel something like a service — but if that’s the way you like to celebrate the holiday season, you’d be hard-pressed to find better music.
