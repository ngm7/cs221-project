‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ Season 2

Starts streaming: Dec. 5, on Amazon.

Now that “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has won eight Emmy Awards, what next? How about Paris and the Catskills? Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan at full sparkle) and her efforts to break into stand-up comedy in the late 1950s are still central, but the show’s world has opened up, along with new opportunities for ensemble players. Some of the best moments are meticulously choreographed set pieces in which cameras and characters glide around each other, with dialogue overlapping. Rarely have scenes of people lugging furniture into a vacation cottage, or answering calls in the switchboard room, been so fascinating to watch. Midge still gets the wittiest rat-a-tat banter, of course, but now she has lots of highly entertaining help. Dizzying and delightful.

‘Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle’

Starts streaming: Dec. 7, on Netflix.

The director and motion-capture master Andy Serkis’s take on “The Jungle Book” is for those who prefer their anthropomorphized animals to look like they actually live in a jungle — in other words, less cute and cuddly and more scruffy and muddy. Adopted by wolves, Mowgli (Rohan Chand) struggles with his precarious place in the pack; if he can’t keep up, he will be cast out. But might this wild child be able to adapt to the human world? A colonial hunter (Matthew Rhys) takes Mowgli under his wing, and Mowgli is befriended by a village woman (Freida Pinto) during Holi festivities. As Mowgli straddles the two worlds — belonging to both and to neither — the story turns dark. And no one, animal or human, gets off easy. Major plus: the stellar voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch (as the tiger Shere Khan) and Christian Bale (as the panther Bagheera).
