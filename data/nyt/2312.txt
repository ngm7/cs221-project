Instead of discouraging Wi-Fi moochers and freelance nomads in its lobbies, the Ace Hotels took another step to actively encourage them and signal their welcome. It put outlets everywhere and catered to the creative crowd.

The midtown Manhattan crowds came quickly for the trendy design, unlocked Wi-Fi — and equally unlocked restrooms.

“What we wanted was for our lobbies to act as community gathering spaces and designed them with that in mind,” Kelly Sawdon, partner and chief creative officer at Ace Hotels, said. “Our hotels are borne from our love for cities and people, and that means providing space for everyone, regardless of whether they’re guests or our neighbors.”

The communal tables at the Ace hotel in New York City are frequently full. The available snacks are ones expected at a trendy coffee shop or bar, not necessarily a hotel’s first floor. From noon to 4 a.m., the lobby bar serves everything from Stumptown coffee, to a crisp tofu bowl and gluten free cannabis brownies (with 12mg of CBD oil).
