“The race is not to the swift,” we learn from Ecclesiastes, “nor the battle to the strong.” But as Damon Runyan once wrote, that’s the way to bet. One of my students at the University of Washington, where I taught animal behavior and evolutionary biology, once asked me if the Bible was inconsistent with evolution by natural selection, since — as she understood it — the biological race is indeed won by the swift and battles by the strong. She was surprised by my response.

I grant that much of the time, Runyon’s cynicism is consistent with the nonhuman world, no less than the human one. When a cheetah chases a gazelle, the race is typically won by whichever is swiftest. This arms race between predator and prey has resulted in remarkable speediness on the part of each: faster gazelles select genetically for faster cheetahs, and vice versa. When two bull elk battle over which one gets to control and mate with a harem of cow elk, I’d bet on the stronger.

But as I explained to my student, even in the supposed world of “nature red in tooth and claw,” the fiercest don’t always win. This is especially true because “winning” in evolutionary terms has very little to do with being victorious mano a mano, and everything to do with being successful in getting one’s genes projected into the future. (More precisely, winning genes are those that manage to promote identical copies of themselves in succeeding generations.)

Examples are legion. Among those highly aggressive bull elk, some individuals spend so much time and energy displaying and fighting that unassuming and unaggressive bulls sometimes sneak into the harem and mate with females while the ostensible lord and master is preoccupied with maintaining his dominion by clashing antlers with his more obvious competitors.
