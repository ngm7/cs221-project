Just before 1 a.m. Saturday, a crew of white supremacist gang members descended on the Rec Room Bar & Grill, a normally relaxed bar in Lynnwood, Wash., about a half-hour drive north of Seattle, the authorities said.

After ordering drinks, they quickly tried to take over the D.J. booth, according to a police report. The D.J., who is African-American, later told The Seattle Times that the group had demanded that he play heavy metal, and that he had queued up Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath.

But it wasn’t fast enough. As the gang members surrounded the 37-year-old D.J., whose name the authorities did not release, he noticed their swastika tattoos, he told the newspaper. They threw him to the ground, beating and stomping him and using racial slurs. The bar manager, whose mother owns the bar and who is Asian-American, tried to intervene and was also beaten. The police said more than a dozen people were involved in the fighting. Frightened patrons called 911.

“For something like this to have happened was incredibly terrifying,” the manager, identified as Jason Baum, told KIRO 7 News.
