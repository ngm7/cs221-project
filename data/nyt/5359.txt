Jane Langton, a prolific New England author who evoked a palpable sense of place in her mysteries and children’s books, and who illustrated many of her works herself, died on Saturday in hospice care near her home in Lincoln, Mass. She was 95.

Her son David Langton said the cause was complications of a respiratory condition.

Ms. Langton’s home, about half an hour’s drive northwest of Boston, was adjacent to the historic town of Concord and a stone’s throw from Walden Pond, places she considered hallowed ground. In her more than 30 books, most of them mysteries and children’s books, she frequently summoned the revolutionary past and the transcendental spirit of Emerson and Thoreau in Concord, a picture-postcard monument to Americana that Boston magazine has called “the world’s quaintest town.”

The titles of Ms. Langton’s books reflect her devotion to the region: “The Transcendental Murder” (1964), “Dark Nantucket Noon” (1975), “Emily Dickinson Is Dead” (1984), “God in Concord” (1992).

“A novel grows out of a sense of place,” Ms. Langton told The Boston Globe in 1995. “A story might have some pompous theme but, really, its meaning must come from an organic relationship with its setting.”
