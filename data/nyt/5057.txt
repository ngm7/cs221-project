There’s nothing like art to bring life to your home, whether it’s a valuable piece you bought in a gallery, or a collection of street art you brought back from vacation. But before you hang it on the wall, consider the backdrop.

The color you paint your wall is as important as the frame you select, said Donald Kaufman, a color consultant who has worked with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

If a frame is good, he explained, “it completely disappears” — and the same goes for the wall color.

“You just don’t want to notice the wall color behind a picture,” Mr. Kaufman said. “You want it to feel like the picture or art is comfortable in its surrounding and allows you to participate with it intensely.”
