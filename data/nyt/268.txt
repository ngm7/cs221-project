In just his second “Saturday Night Live” appearance this season — and his first since his arrest following a dispute over a parking space — Alec Baldwin returned to the program this weekend to portray President Trump in a comedy sketch set at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina.

In the show’s cold open, Baldwin stood on a hotel balcony, complaining to Melania Trump (played by cast member Cecily Strong) that he’d been having trouble sleeping. “I keep having this nightmare where I’m walking through a forest of blood,” he said.

Strong replied, “No, no, that was just my Christmas decorations.”

Baldwin, a frequent “S.N.L.” guest who has portrayed President Trump on the show since 2016, said at the start of this season that he intended to play the role less often.
