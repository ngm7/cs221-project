ARTS & LEISURE

A Critic’s Notebook on Page 10 about the #MeToo movement and the film “If Beale Street Could Talk” misstates the relationship between the characters Fonny and Sharon. Fonny is engaged to Sharon’s daughter, Tish; he is not Sharon’s son.

THE MAGAZINE

An article on Dec. 16 about a warehouse fire in Oakland misidentified a woman who gave a statement at a sentencing hearing and misidentified the victim she spoke of. She is Linda Regan, who spoke about her daughter, Amanda Kershaw, not Susan Slocum, who spoke about her daughter Donna Kellogg. The article also misidentified the college that Peter Wadsworth, who died in the fire, attended. He graduated from Reed College, not Reed University.

OPINION

An Opinion essay on Dec. 16 about the absence of women at architecture firms included outdated information about the number of female principals at the Bjarke Ingels Group. It is two, not one.
