1. Wayne Shorter, ‘Emanon’

Here’s a grand reckoning with the most revered compositional voice in contemporary jazz. The first of three discs here is defined by the kinetic synergy between the saxophonist’s quartet and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. The album isn’t complete without its accompanying graphic novel, written by Mr. Shorter and Monica Sly, and illustrated by Randy DuBurke.

2. Ambrose Akinmusire, ‘Origami Harvest’

For the past decade, Ambrose Akinmusire has played trumpet with a fresh style: elusive and rarely resolving, but also ruby-red and urgent. His newest album reminds us that his compositions can achieve the same balance of intimacy and vision.

3. Logan Richardson, ‘Blues People’

Thrashing and full of impact but endlessly slippery, Logan Richardson’s two-electric-guitar quintet remains guided at every turn by his alto saxophone. No one plays the instrument with the same sweltering, swooning grace.

4. Esperanza Spalding, ‘12 Little Spells’

Esperanza Spalding took her time on this one, crafting a video album of millennial-size ambition, ranging from orchestral jazz with loquacious lyrics to therapeutic funk. Altogether, it’s a little like experiencing the ecstatic philosophy of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (her writings on, say, the interrelation of language, desire and physical texture) as sounds and moving images.
