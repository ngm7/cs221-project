TOKYO — Disarray at the top of the world’s largest auto-making consortium intensified Monday after Nissan’s directors failed to nominate a new chairman, and Renault pushed for a public discussion of the growing risks it faces in a financial reporting scandal that led to the jailing of Carlos Ghosn, the alliance’s hard-charging chief.

Nissan, of Japan, and Renault, based in France, have a longstanding partnership that is considered essential to both carmakers’ success. On Monday, they appeared to be increasingly at odds over how to cope with the huge gap in top management caused by Mr. Ghosn’s arrest last month. He was indicted on charges that he underreported his pay in violation of Japanese securities laws, and Nissan itself was also accused of violating the laws.

Mr. Ghosn, who was simultaneously chairman of Nissan, chairman and chief executive of Renault and chairman of the Nissan-Renault alliance, has been in a Tokyo jail since his arrest on Nov. 19, unable to communicate directly with either carmaker.

Renault, which is Nissan’s largest shareholder, has become increasingly worried that the accusations against Nissan and Mr. Ghosn could damage both companies’ reputations and even their credit ratings, according to a person with direct knowledge of Renault’s thinking.
