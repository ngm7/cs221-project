High style meets low-tech in this Italian toaster created in 1997 for Trabo by Gae Aulenti, the architect who designed the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. Until about a year ago it was sold only in Europe; now it’s available in the United States. Its sleek simplicity could make it the pride of the kitchen counter. It handles two slices, but not a thick bagel. Wire racks are included, to hold the bread (or a sandwich wrapped in parchment paper).
