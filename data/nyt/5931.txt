A man who was in the United States illegally and involved in a street gang was arrested on Friday in connection with the shooting death of a California police officer during a traffic stop two days earlier, the authorities said.

The man, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, 32, was taken into custody at a home near Bakersfield, Calif., Sheriff Adam Christianson of the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department said at a news conference on Friday. The police, following leads in their search for the gunman, had the home under surveillance for more than 24 hours after the shooting of the officer, Ronil Singh, 33, of the Newman Police Department.

Officer Singh was shot after stopping a driver, identified by officials as Mr. Perez Arriaga, on suspicion of drunken driving, in Newman, Calif., which is not far from Modesto. Officer Singh was then taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to a statement from the Sheriff’s Department.
