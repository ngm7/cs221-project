Neither quarterback was supposed to succeed quickly in the N.F.L. — many thought Jackson could not succeed as a quarterback at all — but in the second half of the season few have been better.

Mayfield’s breakout came after Freddie Kitchens took over as Cleveland’s offensive coordinator in Week 9. Since then the Browns have been 5-2 and Mayfield has completed more than 70 percent of his passes, with 16 touchdowns and just five interceptions. An injury to Joe Flacco made Jackson the starter in Week 11, and since then, Baltimore has been 5-1. While Jackson’s arm is still a work in progress, he has spearheaded a rushing effort that averaged 218.5 yards a game over the last six weeks.

Mayfield beat the Ravens in Week 5 — back in the Flacco era — but Sunday’s game will be an entirely new challenge for both teams. Nick Chubb, Cleveland’s breakout rookie running back, will face a nearly impossible task trying to run against Baltimore’s terrific front seven, so this game will probably swing on whether Mayfield succeeds against the Ravens’ secondary.

Playing at home and with a playoff spot in reach, the Ravens have the scales tipped slightly in their favor. But this game appears like the kind that will be decided by a field goal or less, rather than the 6 points Las Vegas has spotted Baltimore.

The Steelers, meanwhile, are likely to win, but beating a division rival by more than two touchdowns seems like a lot to ask. Picks: Browns +6; Bengals +14.5
