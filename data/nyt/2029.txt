Sidney Horenstein, an exuberant geologist whose popular books, guided tours and urban bias brought him fame as a champion of the rock that New York City is built upon (and with), died on Dec. 5 in Manhattan. He was 82.

His wife, Marcia, said the cause was respiratory failure.

A staff geologist and coordinator of environmental public programs at the American Museum of Natural History and a lecturer at Hunter College in New York, Mr. Horenstein was an expert on the tectonic upheavals that shaped what was left of New York City’s natural landscape.

While other earth scientists might prefer prospecting in an unbuilt environment, Mr. Horenstein called New York “one of the great geologic meccas in the world” and a “geological smorgasbord.”

“The whole geology of the world is right here in New York City,” he told The New York Times in 1991. “Walk down Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue and you can reconstruct the history of the world from rocks that are used for building purposes.”
