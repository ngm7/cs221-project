LONDON — As a teenager, Michael Andrew came within a second of fulfilling a dream and making the United States swim team for the 2016 Olympics. Now he risks missing out on the 2020 Games in Tokyo for altogether different reasons.

Andrew, a world champion, is at the forefront of a battle being waged by some of elite swimming’s biggest names against the sport’s governing body in a fight that threatens to have repercussions beyond the pool. The dispute highlights rising tensions between athletes determined to maximize their earning potential and organizations intent on protecting guiding principles forged in the amateur era.

Organizers scrapped plans for a lucrative independent meet in Turin, Italy, this year after FINA, the international swimming federation, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, threatened competitors with bans from the sport’s biggest events, including the Olympics, which remains unsurpassed in terms of profile and prestige in elite swimming. The resentment has only grown since.

Andrew joined about 30 swimmers — a group that included several world and Olympic champions — in London this week for two days of meetings to discuss ways to take on swimming’s power brokers. He left saying that they should be willing to be barred if it meant athletes had greater control over their destinies rather than being limited to competitions controlled by the governing body.
