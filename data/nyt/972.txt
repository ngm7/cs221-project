There aren’t many people left on earth who can speak to the spirit of Alvin Ailey — not in terms of his dances or the institution he created, but the man. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater celebrates its 60th anniversary this season and along with that, the work of another choreographer who mercifully is on the earth right now: Ronald K. Brown. Through his dances, he speaks to the spirt of Ailey, and for nearly 20 years now he has enriched Ailey’s company with unaffected, soulful choreography that gives its dancers dimension and depth.

His latest, “The Call,” which had its debut at New York City Center on Tuesday, is Mr. Brown at his essence. His dances, earthy and subtly rapturous, tell stories of spirituality by weaving a tapestry of modern dance and West African forms. He can make a dance about love and not be corny; that sentiment is at the root of “The Call” — which he has described it as a love letter to Ailey, whose choreography he first encountered when he was 8. After seeing that performance, he made his first dance.

Mixed in with Mr. Brown’s soft swaying twists of the arms and hips are details and shapes taken from the Ailey canon. In this way, “The Call” — Mr. Brown’s seventh piece for the Ailey company — is something of a conversation between the choreographers, a beauty of a dance that ripples along while highlighting Ailey’s formality, his ebullience and how he came to find his choreographic voice.
