Real Madrid has won the Champions League three straight times. On Saturday, it will go for its third straight title in the Club World Cup, FIFA’s biggest club competition.

And of all the clubs around the world, the one that will try to stop mighty Real in the final is … Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates?

Though nominally a world championship event, the Club World Cup has struggled to be viewed as more than a glorified friendly, especially by the top European teams. Since the Cup started playing its current format, in 2005, the European entrant has made every final, and it has won 10 of the last 11 events.

Few think that trend is going to change when Real faces Al Ain. The clubs almost play a different sport. Real has 13 Champions League titles. Al Ain has one Asian Champions League title, in 2003.
