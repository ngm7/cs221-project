The title of Sebastián Silva’s film “Tyrel” comes from a momentary mispronunciation of the African-American protagonist’s name, but it speaks to the simmering discomfort summoned by this agonizingly dead-on cringe comedy-drama.

Tyler (Jason Mitchell) is a chef who’s been invited by his close friend Johnny (Christopher Abbott) to spend a snowy weekend at a mountain cabin celebrating the birthday of the wild-man artist Pete (Caleb Landry Jones) with a bunch of other guests. Tyler really knows only Johnny, but the others — all white, all dudes — immediately start to include him in their dumb jokes and inane banter. They may have intended to make him feel welcome, but their actions wind up having the opposite effect, as Tyler finds himself increasingly entrapped by their booze-soaked machismo — by their vaguely offensive games, their made-up rituals, their childish horseplay.

There’s also a racial element to many of the exchanges — sometimes veiled, sometimes obvious. It happens to be the weekend of Donald Trump’s inauguration, a fact that at first seems like a narrative grace note, but gradually takes on more significance, as these ostensibly progressive men are somehow both overtly solicitous of and subtly dismissive of Tyler’s opinions.
