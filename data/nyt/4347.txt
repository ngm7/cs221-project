“Working here is fantastic,” said Ladislav Vlna, a Czech artist who made headlines for his use of a blowtorch and power tools to “paint” large-scale portraits on metal sheets. “It’s warm, there’s plenty of room, and we have a lovely cafe. And if you use a very noisy tool to make art, there’s no problem, because no one actually lives here.”

Experimental spaces

Halfway across town, another creative space has opened in an old military barracks near the western edge of the trendy Karlin district.

“This used to be a changing room,” said Matej Velek, the director of the project, gesturing around a stylish cafe near the empty pool, which now serves as a performing arts space. Original changing-room tiles don’t look out of place in the minimalist cafe, which serves, among other things, Czech lager, French wine and coffee drinks.

The cafe is part of Kasarna Karlin, a new project that is making temporary use of the barracks. In this case, “temporary” probably means between five and 10 years, while the building’s owner decides what to do with it.

Originally built in 1848, the block-length barracks was floated for possible privatization in 2013, while it was still the property of the Czech government, a fate that has befallen many Prague buildings that were once considered public property. Instead, it was transferred from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Justice, who then worked with the local city government to find a suitable tenant.
