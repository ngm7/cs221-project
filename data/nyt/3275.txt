Stocks on Wall Street notched a new low for the year on Monday, as worries about the economy continued to dog investors ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision on interest rates later this week.

It was the latest in a string of volatile trading sessions that has left investors limping through the last weeks of 2018. Since stocks reached a record high in September, the market has been buffeted by a range of concerns, from signs that the trade war between China and the United States is beginning to weigh on global growth to worries that higher interest rates will eat into corporate profits.

It made for a shaky day in the markets. Crude oil dove. Corporate bonds were lower. Stocks dropped almost across the board, with shares of tech, health care and small companies as well as blue-chip corporations all lower.

When the dust had cleared, the S&P 500 was down 2.1 for the day and 4.8 percent for the year. Should the market fail to recover, 2018 would be Wall Streetâ€™s worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago.
