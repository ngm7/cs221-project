The countdown continues today with what I think is the fourth most important story of the year: President Trump’s many scandals.

Are you surprised I haven’t ranked them higher?

I certainly can see an argument for doing so. But hear me out: President Trump is indeed the most scandal -marred president of our lifetimes, if not longer. At this point, though, the basic story line is clear. We didn’t learn anything new about his character in 2018. The question is how the country responds to his obviously unpresidential behavior. I’ll address that issue later this week.
