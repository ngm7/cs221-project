NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 28, 8 p.m.). The second holiday concert from this group is a heavy-hitting one fit for its special 50th anniversary concert. Joshua Bell is on hand as the soloist in Brahms’s Violin Concerto, and there’s also Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 6, the “Pathétique,” and George Walker’s “Lyric for Strings.” Jaime Laredo and Karina Canellakis conduct.

TENET VOCAL ARTISTS at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste (Jan. 3, 7:30 p.m.; Jan. 6, 2 p.m.). This group, a mainstay of the New York Baroque scene, has made a specialty of Monteverdi’s vocal music over the years through its Green Mountain Project. Here, in honor of the project’s 10th anniversary, they perform the 1610 Vespers, as part of a mini-festival that also includes a performance of 16th-century Spanish music from the outstanding Boston vocal ensemble Blue Heron, on Jan. 5.
