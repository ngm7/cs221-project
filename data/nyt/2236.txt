In the midst of the solemn starkness of “The Prisoner,” the new play by Peter Brook and Marie-Hélène Estienne, there’s a moment you will want to memorize and nurture. The title character, a young man who will soon begin serving a long sentence in a desert, is allowed one last visit to the forest where he played as a child.

The air vibrates with the songs of birds, and the man, Mavuso (Hiran Abeysekera), answers them in shy whistles. His face, which has been fixed in blankness, opens up into a tentative smile. Like the boy he was, he climbs a tree — or to be literal, a pole leading to a balcony from the stage of the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, where “The Prisoner” opened on Monday night.

The inhabitants of the balcony look delighted as well as startled. And a warmth, as welcome as sunshine in February, spreads through the audience. No wonder that Mavuso has been told by his uncle, Ezekiel (Hervé Goffings), “I want you to keep this inside you. It will help you.”

The advice is worth heeding by anyone who sees “The Prisoner,” which has been brought to New York by the Theater for a New Audience. That sylvan interlude is one of the few glimmers of something like happiness in this cryptic production from the Paris-based C.I.C.T./Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord.
