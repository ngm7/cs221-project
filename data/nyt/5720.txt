For many Americans, wine is something to be studied rather than felt.

Of course, wine is an alcoholic beverage, and plenty of people drink it for exactly that reason, paying little attention to anything beyond a pleasant flavor and an enjoyable buzz. But for those who have decided to plunge deeper, wine often becomes a course of study, a subject to be mastered.

We practice tasting wines blind in order to divine their identities, narrowing down the options through careful deduction. We memorize places, people, soil types and grapes. We take courses in “wine appreciation,” so that we are equipped to comprehend it in all its aesthetic glory.

Yet the intense attachment many people feel to certain wines is powerfully emotional. Our taste is personal, and woe to anyone who would seem to demean another’s favorite.

Here at Wine School, we try to recognize both sides of this equation. We believe that a better understanding of where wine comes from, who made it and why leads to deeper pleasures in its consumption. That’s why we are called Wine School, after all.
