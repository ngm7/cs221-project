PARIS — No matter what took place at the draw for the 2019 Women’s World Cup on Saturday night, one thing was never going to change: the United States women’s national team would be widely regarded as the favorite to win, with all the hope and expectation and pressure that comes with that.

After all, the Americans are the defending champions, having beaten Japan to win the previous edition of the tournament in Canada and take home the trophy for the third time.

But Jill Ellis, the head coach of the United States, objected to that framing of her squad.

“For us, it’s not about defending a World Cup,” Ellis said. “This is a completely different team, playing a different style, a different system.

“It’s about attacking a World Cup.”

To that end, Ellis was pleased with the outcome of the draw, which placed the United States in Group F with Sweden, Thailand and Chile.
