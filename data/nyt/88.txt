WASHINGTON — Melissa Peterman, the actress and comedian, scooped up Kristin Chenoweth like a bride, whisking her off the stage as Reba McEntire blew kisses from the balcony.

With a hand over his heart, Lin-Manuel Miranda performed “One Last Time” from “Hamilton,” earning a standing ovation as he honored the Broadway musical he created.

And at the sight of Cyndi Lauper, ready to perform, Cher bellowed across the Kennedy Center Opera House, “You told me you were going to Los Angeles.” (“I lied,” Lauper yelled back.)

It was all part of the sequined fete at the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday, where a star-studded menagerie of artists, political leaders and Washington socialites gathered to recognize a handful of artistic titans for their cultural contributions.
