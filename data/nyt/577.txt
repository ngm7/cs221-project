In researching his new book, Mr. Freedman found himself focused on the now-entrenched reality of age segregation in the United States, and what can be done to bring older Americans back into the fold, especially as more people are living longer.

The following conversation has been edited and condensed.

What is age segregation and how did it become, in many ways, an American norm?

Much of that whole conception was invented with a profit motive in mind and out of a real feeling that older people were superfluous. And it was invented so recently, within the last half a century or so: the idea being that people are kind of drifting through this anteroom to the great beyond.

And these entrepreneurs came in and realized there’s some money to be made here, and they invented the idea of the golden years, that this should all be about leisure. Dying went from just a natural part of life into an incurable medical condition. That really contributed a lot to segregation, to developing all these institutions where the elderly became separated from society.

As this period in life has grown, we really haven’t had a culture of the institutions to deal with it. It’s been described as a season in search of a purpose. And so we filled that gap with a lot of leisure activities and this frenzied pursuit of a second childhood. But in fact it doesn’t fit with what we know developmentally, that this is perhaps not the most fulfilling approach to that period of life.
