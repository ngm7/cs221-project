There are two reasons I still pay for cable: 1. NY1 (local news, Jamie Stelter and Pat Kiernan). 2. Hallmark Christmas movies.

I am not someone these movies should appeal to. I will usually take horror movies over rom-coms. I don’t dream about planning the perfect wedding. And I’ve never said, “It’s the season of miracles,” without a strong dose of sarcasm.

Still, when I go home to Oregon at Thanksgiving every year, cuddling up on the couch with my mom and my brother, watching these movies is the best kind of comfort. They bring us together to get teary over happy endings (me, often; my brother on rare occasions), as well as incredulous (me) over how characters who are supposed to be journalists are portrayed.

Though I usually stick with Hallmark movies, this year I strayed from my main squeeze and headed to Netflix to see how its holiday fare compared.
