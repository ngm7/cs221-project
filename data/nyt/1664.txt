I had “Story” for STORM, “ESP” for ASL, “cut out” for RESECT, “Marist” for VASSAR, “hyped” for AMPED — many, many misdirects, Mr. Trudeau, to my DETRIMENT. And yet, I persisted, for it is only a complete report that earns me the big bucks, and upon completion I had that feeling that you get when you ski down a particularly narrow slope with your heart in your throat, only to look up at the end and think, “Oh! That was totally fun, not too steep and worth it.”

4A: “Inspector Gadget” dates to 1982, but the villainous DR CLAW is a Times debut, which made me feel better about not knowing it, so I figured I’d spread the love. This show illustrates one of life’s inequities — the good guy can have all manner of technology at his or her disposal and still get defeated by a big sharp claw.

50A: Shameless plug, but Jersey, one of the ISLES of the English Channel, is the site of an amazing zoo created by Gerald Durrell in 1959. I just learned that you can “glamp” there, something I hereby resolve to do in 2019 and report back on forthwith.

16D: A modern clue, I thought, for a bit of an anachronism: HOMEMAKERS. We’ve had the entry before, singular and plural, clued like “many a sitcom mom” or “housewife” (or “builder,” in history’s defense, but still not quite right). “Homewreckers” has appeared exactly once, clued as “women who go after other women’s men,” but this was all the way back in the Dark Ages of, um, 1999.
