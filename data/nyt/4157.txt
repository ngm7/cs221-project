A few weeks ago, we asked you to share your memories of the first time you encountered racism or a racist belief. We were overwhelmed by the responses, and wanted to share some of them with you.

The first one comes to us from Robert Goldfarb, 89, a consultant from the Bronx who said he subscribed to Race/Related because, “I served alongside men smarter, more competent and physically my superior who were often judged not by their excellence as soldiers, but by their race.” His story has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
