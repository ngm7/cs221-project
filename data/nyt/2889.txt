The word prodigious has appeared in 343 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Nov. 16 in “Trump Awards Medals of Freedom to Elvis, Babe Ruth and Miriam Adelson” by Michael Tackett:

But Mr. Trump chose to go far back in time in choosing both Presley, who died in 1977, and Ruth, the Yankees slugger who has been dead longer than all but one other previous recipient, Mr. Kopko said. Mr. Trump was 2 when Ruth died, in 1948. A man of many nicknames, “the Babe,” “the Bambino” and “the Sultan of Swat,” and perhaps the most famous baseball player, George Herman Ruth Jr. led the Yankees to seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. He was a prodigious fund-raiser for World War II causes. Mr. Trump said Ruth “raised money and raised hell” and said that was perhaps why the honor was so long in coming.
