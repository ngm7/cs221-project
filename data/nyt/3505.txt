BUDAPEST — At least four opposition lawmakers were assaulted on Monday in Hungary, one of whom was hospitalized, after they visited the state media headquarters to request that the broadcasters end their wall-to-wall support for Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban.

After a 10-hour standoff in which editors refused to give the legislators airtime, security guards forcibly ejected two of the lawmakers. A third, Laszlo Varju, managed to stay inside with several colleagues, but was injured during a scuffle with security guards later in the day. He was eventually taken to a hospital in an ambulance.

A fourth lawmaker was subsequently injured when she tried to burst through police lines to assist Mr. Varju.

The episode, which followed nearly a week of growing protests against the government’s increasingly authoritarian behavior, was a turning point for Hungary under Mr. Orban.
