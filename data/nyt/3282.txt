“It was her and I with the Pacers,” Bob Leonard, known as Slick, told The Indianapolis Star in June. “Nancy ran the business side, and I was responsible for the coaching.”

Pritchard told the newspaper Monday that Krauskopf’s role would focus “strictly on basketball.”

“As the architect of one of the W.N.B.A.’s most successful franchises, Kelly is a true pioneer in our sport,” the Pacers’ owner, Herb Simon, said in a statement. “I’ve worked with Kelly over the past two decades, so I know her tremendous basketball mind, strong work ethic and proven leadership skills will continue to be of great benefit to our organization.”

Krauskopf began working in the W.N.B.A. league office in 1996 and joined the Pacers’ organization in 1999 when they were granted a W.N.B.A. expansion franchise. For the past year-plus, she has also been an e-sports executive, overseeing the Pacers’ NBA2K league team.

“The chance to work in an N.B.A. front office for a first-class organization filled with great people I know and in a city that has become my home is extraordinary,” Krauskopf said in a statement. “My past experience has shown me that building winning teams and elite level culture is not based on gender — it is based on people and processes.”

The Fever made 13 playoff appearances under Krauskopf’s leadership as team president and general manager, including three trips to the W.N.B.A. finals, and a league championship in 2012.
