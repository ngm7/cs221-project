TYREL (2018) on iTunes. Jason Mitchell (“Mudbound,” “Straight Outta Compton”) stars in this wince-worthy comedy-drama from the Chilean director Sebastián Silva. Mitchell plays Tyler, a young, African-American chef on a wooded retreat/birthday celebration that he’s been invited to by a close friend (Christopher Abbott). It’s an event where everyone else is white and male — and one at which Tyler begins to feel unwelcome. “As more and more friends pile into the crowded house over the weekend, what began as a delicate look at the awkward feeling of being an outsider gradually becomes a mortifying descent into brotastic boorishness,” Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The Times. Ebiri called the film “agonizingly dead-on.”

THE AMERICAN MEME (2018) on Netflix. Bert Marcus’s documentary delves into four prominent social-media users — Paris Hilton, Josh Ostrovsky, Brittany Furlan and Kirill Bichutsky — to show how an online celebrity is made.
