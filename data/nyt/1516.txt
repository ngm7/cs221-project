In the first bars of Webern’s arrangement of “Tränenregen,” a clarinet solo answered by an oboe vividly renders the two lovers sitting by a stream who become the subject of the song. In “Des Fischers Liebesglück,” in a 2015 arrangement by Alexander Schmalcz, a plaintive theme is picked up by different instruments. When it is finally played up by the flute, it seems to lift up, its inherent melancholy sublimated into a spiritual dimension.

Mr. Goerne’s singing amply complements the full orchestral palette. His baritone has an earthy solidity in its low range, but can lighten to a soft ribbon of sound. With his striking command of legato, melodies flow in a broad stream, embedded in but never overpowered by the ensemble.

The Strauss selections have Wagnerian heft and churn built into them. “Ruhe, meine Seele” came across as stormy and claustrophobic at once in Mr. Goerne’s powerful rendition. Mr. van Zweden drew beautifully nuanced playing from the Philharmonic musicians. In “Morgen,” it was the orchestra’s concertmaster, Frank Huang, who brought the song to a close with a solo of hushed mystery.

The orchestra sounded less assured in Webern’s cerebral arrangement of the Fugue from Bach’s “Musical Offering,” which opened the program. Here, Webern isolates musical molecules and distributes them across the ensemble in a way that is devilishly hard to balance. But the textures were evenly weighted in the unfussy, stylish reading of Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 that ended the evening.
