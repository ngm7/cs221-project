Season 4, Episode 8, ‘Wilmington’

In this episode, Jamie and Claire go to the theater, and the play’s so bad the crowd bails on it to watch Claire perform hernia surgery instead. It’s a telling moment in an episode that shows two very different ways to put a character in peril, and the implications of the stories “Outlander” is telling.

First, Jamie. Jamie himself is perfectly safe sitting beside the friendly Governor. But the Governor set a trap for Regulators and Murtagh’s on the front line, so Jaime’s in peril by proxy. There’s the immediate danger to Murtagh — and the fact that Jamie’s closest friend just doesn’t trust him like he used to. (When Fergus tells him Jamie couldn’t come because he was at the theater, Murtagh makes an incredible face.) But the deeper peril is that Jamie’s hope of not having to pick a side is an impossible dream. He has to accept he’s at war.

There are plenty of machinations involved in warning Murtagh: Jamie precipitates Fanning’s hernia surgery, catches a ride with George Washington, and sends Fergus to Murtagh as he races back to the theater. But the chaos has character behind it. The audience knows Claire can handle the surgery and the skeptics, and we know Murtagh trusts Fergus. “Outlander” laid that groundwork for us over time; we’re happy to excuse a convenient hernia when the characters themselves make sense.

Which makes Brianna and Roger’s story all the more frustrating.

When Roger first proposed to Brianna, he proposed to his dream of her. When Brianna had her own ideas about their relationship and her plans for the future, he reacted badly. We knew his cruelty was important, because the camera lingered on how hurt Brianna was in its wake. It was clear Roger had work to do before Brianna trusted him again.
