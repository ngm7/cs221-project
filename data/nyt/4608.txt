Smile Direct Club is another company that has moved away from “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” but a spokeswoman said it had decided to cease advertising on all political opinion shows. Several other advertisers, including Bayer, Mitsubishi Motors North America and Farmers Insurance, said they would not change their spending.

Mr. Carlson is not the first Fox News host to face an advertiser backlash. In March, a group of companies pulled their ads from Laura Ingraham’s show after she taunted a survivor of the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. She subsequently apologized.

Last year, more than 50 brands stopped advertising on “The O’Reilly Factor” after The New York Times reported on settlements that its host, Bill O’Reilly, had made with women who had accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior. That contributed to his ouster; Mr. Carlson now holds down Mr. O’Reilly’s old time slot.

Just over a year ago, several brands said they would stop advertising on the show hosted by Sean Hannity, the highest-rated Fox News host, after comments he made about Roy S. Moore, who was then Alabama’s Republican candidate for Senate. The companies later backed away from those statements, and “Hannity” was relatively unaffected.

Those leading calls for a boycott of Mr. Carlson’s show included the filmmaker Judd Apatow and the Twitter account Sleeping Giants, which was created to notify brands if they were appearing on Breitbart News, the hard-edge, nationalist news site.

Fox News said in a statement that Mr. Carlson was the focus of “agenda-driven intimidation efforts” and that he was “being threatened via Twitter by far-left activist groups with deeply political motives.”

It added, “While we do not advocate boycotts, these same groups never target other broadcasters and operate under a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view.”
