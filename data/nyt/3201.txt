We may hear from Cohen again soon

Court papers submitted in advance of Mr. Cohen’s sentencing outline some of the information he provided to Mr. Mueller’s office. The papers say that Mr. Cohen’s information was “credible and consistent with other evidence obtained” by the special counsel and “has been useful in four significant respects.”

Among other things, Mr. Mueller’s office said in court papers that Mr. Cohen said an unnamed Russian offered him “government level” synergy between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign in November 2015, months earlier than other approaches detailed in indictments secured by prosecutors.

Though the court papers provided few details about the information he provided, it seems clear that some or all of that material could very well end up surfacing in the not-too-distant future. It could wind up in one of the criminal cases that are anticipated in the coming months, or in a report Mr. Mueller is expected to produce at the conclusion of his inquiry.

The case is over — but not really

Mr. Cohen’s three-year prison term seems to signify the end of the federal case against him, but as Yogi Berra reputedly said, “It ain’t over till it’s over,” in more ways than one.

For starters, the investigation that resulted in the charges against Mr. Cohen and his guilty plea has now shifted to focus on Mr. Trump’s family real estate company and whether several executives there may have known about or played a role in the hush-money payments.

And some of the information Mr. Cohen provided to prosecutors has intensified that inquiry, a person briefed on the matter has said.
