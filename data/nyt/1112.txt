In the N.F.L., where the wait between most games is a long, charged week, tales of eccentric pregame rituals in the final jittery moments before kickoff have become a fabled part of the sport’s lore.

If, for example, a team is on a win streak, superstitious players might make sure to put on their uniforms exactly as they had in previous weeks: left sock first, then the right sock; left pant leg before the right pant leg, and so on.

Or, a motivational sign above the locker room door could be considered a good-luck charm and be tapped, or slapped, as everyone exits the room. A team might also file onto the field in the same numerical order week after week — all in the search of positive juju.

But this is the modern N.F.L., a multibillion dollar enterprise celebrating its centennial next season. Surely, mystical rituals are abating in the analytics era, right?
