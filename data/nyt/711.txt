There are countless menorahs, the candelabras designed for Hanukkah, when the eight candles are lit, night by night, with blessings and the shamash, or “helper candle.” Starting Dec. 6, the museum in the historic Eldridge Street Synagogue will give you some idea of the variety. Scores of menorahs from the private collection of Aharon Ben Zalman — from countries across the globe and including some from colonial America, 16th-century Italy and modern India — will be on view for several months.

“Lighting the World: Menorahs Around the Globe,” Dec. 6 through spring 2019, Museum at Eldridge Street, 12 Eldridge Street (Canal Street), 212-219-0302, eldridgestreet.org.
