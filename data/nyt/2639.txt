South Korea is known for its robust beauty industry, with the country’s focus on personal appearance so intense that it has recently drawn a backlash.

But now the industry faces unwelcome attention of a different sort: a company’s decision to market Kim Jong-un beauty masks — complete with “nuclear bomb” packaging that promises to moisturize and whiten the face — has led to such an uproar that the product has been pulled from some store shelves.

More than 25,000 of these facial masks, which feature the North Korean leader’s face and blocky hairline, have been sold online and in stores since June, according to 5149, the South Korean cosmetics and fashion company that produced them. The company’s chief executive, Kwak Hyeon-ju, said she wanted the mask packs to celebrate what she called the “once in a lifetime” inter-Korean summits earlier this year.

But as word of the unconventional product has spread, so has the criticism, leading one chain store, Pierrot Shopping, to remove the product from shelves following critical coverage in a major South Korean newspaper. Some say that such mockery of Mr. Kim only softens the image of North Korea, effectively creating propaganda for the regime.
