Soon after the Globe report was published on Monday, a video was posted on Mr. Spacey’s Twitter account. In the roughly three-minute clip, called “Let Me Be Frank” (a likely reference to Frank Underwood, the character he played on the Netflix show “House of Cards”), Mr. Spacey gives a monologue while wearing an apron and working in the kitchen.

“I know what you want,” Mr. Spacey says with a deep Southern accent, staring straight at the camera. “Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong. It’s too powerful. I mean, after all, we shared everything, you and I. I told you my deepest, darkest secrets. I showed you exactly what people are capable of. I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly I challenged you and made you think. And you trusted me, even though you knew you shouldn’t. So we’re not done no matter what anyone says.”

Ms. Unruh said at a news conference last year that Mr. Spacey gave her son “drink after drink,” before reaching down his pants and touching his genitals at a restaurant called the Club Car. Ms. Unruh’s son told Mr. Spacey that he was 21, although he was only 18, according to Ms. Unruh, but she added: “Kevin Spacey had no right to sexually assault him. There was no consent.”

Ms. Unruh did not respond to a request for comment.

She is one of more than a dozen people who have accused Mr. Spacey of sexual misconduct. The first was the actor Anthony Rapp, who said Mr. Spacey made an inappropriate sexual advance on him in Mr. Spacey’s apartment in 1986 when he was just 14 years old. Mr. Spacey apologized on Twitter and came out as gay with a statement that came under an avalanche of criticism.

Just days after the Rapp accusations were made public in October 2017, Mr. Spacey’s publicist provided a statement to The New York Times that said Mr. Spacey was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”
