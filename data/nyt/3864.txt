What’s Streaming

NICO, 1988 (2018) on Hulu. Near the beginning of Susanna Nicchiarelli’s biopic about the German singer Christa Päffgen (better known as Nico, and played by Trine Dyrholm), a radio interviewer asks, “So, do you want to tell us something about your experience with the Velvet Underground?” The singer, cigarette in hand, replies: “No, I don’t.” Nicchiarelli’s film doesn’t focus on the period Nico was best known for — the late 1960s, when she was a vocalist for the Velvet Underground and a close associate of Andy Warhol. Instead, Nicchiarelli shines a light on the star’s later days, focusing on a European tour and a heroin addiction. In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called the film “brilliantly unsentimental,” writing that Nicchiarelli “deftly connects the carefree chaos of Päffgen’s past to the dark desperation of her present.”
