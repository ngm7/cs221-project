For the next week, former President George Bush will be mourned and honored in Texas, where he lived for most of his life and will be buried, and in Washington, where he spent the most formative years of his political career.

Mr. Bush will be honored with a state funeral, which traditionally consists of three parts for up to 10 days. The former president was celebrated in Texas, his state of residence, before his coffin was transported to ceremonies in Washington. Mr. Bush’s coffin will then be returned to Texas for a final funeral and burial.

[The former president will be remembered in a series of memorial services this week. Here are The New York Times’s best photos.]

President Trump, in a gesture of respect for Mr. Bush’s legacy, ordered all flags flown at half-staff for 30 days beginning last Friday, the day Mr. Bush died. He also designated Wednesday a national day of mourning, ordering “all executive departments and agencies” to be closed.
