Politics and Poetry

To the Editor:

I’m writing in response to the digital headline, “Suddenly, Poets Are More Willing to Address Public Concerns,” for the Tracy K. Smith essay that also appeared in print on Dec. 16.

As one who has read, studied and written poetry for the past 40-plus years and as the host/administrator of a poetry group on Facebook that now numbers almost 8,000 members around the globe, thank you for this essay. It will come as welcome — indeed, shocking — news to our members that poets are “suddenly” writing about matters of “public concern.”

For as long as there has been poetry, poets have been addressing such matters, be they earthquakes in Lisbon, public hangings, slavery, the “troubles” in Ireland, the savagery of war and so on.

This may be due to the fact that — like plumbers, carpenters, bakers — poets live and work in the societies about which they write. The notion that poets live in some insular world, isolated from all that surrounds them, is too silly to be endorsed by your newspaper.
