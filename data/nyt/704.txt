Since we believe that only the quality of your work should matter — not who m you know, how much money you have or your race, gender, ethnic background or sexual orientation — we are again bringing together 160 talented photographers with 75 top photo editors, publishers, video producers, gallery owners and curators for the New York Portfolio Review on March 30 and 31st.

Apply now for the free (yes, free) seventh annual review, produced by The New York Times Lens column, the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism and United Photo Industries. Anyone over 18 years old can apply, and all types of photography will be considered. But remember, the application deadline is rapidly approaching: Dec. 10 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.

This will be an opportunity for people in the photographic community to meet, trade ideas, help each other — and have fun.

The first session, on Saturday, March 30, will be for photographers 18 and older. Each participant will receive six private critiques. The second session, on Sunday, March 31, will be solely for photographers 18 to 27 and will consist of at least four private critiques for each participant, as well as free workshops on how to best present, promote and publish photographs. We will screen all applicants and choose 100 participants for Saturday and 60 for Sunday.
