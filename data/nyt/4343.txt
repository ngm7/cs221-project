Miss Porter’s School, the elite all-girls high school in Farmington, Conn., will hold an auction made up entirely of work by female artists.

The sale, “By Women, for Tomorrow’s Women,” will take place March 1, 2019 at Sotheby’s in New York. It is being marketed as the first-ever all-female-artist benefit auction at a major auction house, with sales going to support financial aid at Miss Porter’s School.

It will include works by more than 25 artists, including the sculptor Alice Aycock, the painter Cecily Brown, the conceptual artist Jenny Holzer and the visual artists Dorothea Rockburne and Carmen Herrera. Among the works up for sale is a painting from Herrera’s “Blanco y Verde” series that was exhibited as part of a 2016 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

“We’re well aware of the fact that women artists are not represented in installations and museums,” said Katherine Windsor, the head of school at Miss Porter’s. Dr. Windsor said that the intent of the auction is to “lift up women artists and get people’s attention.”
