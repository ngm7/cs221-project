WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Alan Arbesfeld makes a mean midweek puzzle, doesn’t he? I thought I had my dates wrong. (That’s a frequent nightmare, by the way, when I’m filling in for Deb. I can definitely see myself writing about the wrong puzzle one day and getting tossed out on my crossword-loving keister.)

I’d call it a quantum leap in difficulty from yesterday, so if you’re feeling at all shellshocked, rest assured you’re not alone. Once I got the gist of the very clever theme I muddled through, but even after solving, every time I look at those entries I have to take another cognitive step to read them correctly.

Tricky Clues

For this reason and that I mixed up “Malta” with YALTA, “side” with EDGE and “looses” with LETS AT.
