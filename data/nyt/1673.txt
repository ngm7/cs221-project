On a recent morning, the guy mopping the bar in Chelsea was wearing a suit and tie.

The man, Kevin Carr, had a job interview later that day. But he did not want to neglect his current part-time job — one of several — cleaning and prepping the bar before its doors opened hours later.

“I never thought I’d say I take pride, at my age, in taking three part-time jobs,” said Mr. Carr, 46. “But I do.”

Mr. Carr has always hustled, which served him well in the world of video production. At 20, he moved from New York to Los Angeles and broke into the industry, landing prominent work as a creator, producer and distributor of commercial video projects. His employers included The Associated Press and On the Scene Productions, which worked for companies like Nike and entertainers like Billy Joel.

In 2016, Mr. Carr took a job as a production manager at Thomson Reuters and moved to New York City, settling in Prospect Park South with his dog, Serena, an Australian cattle and beagle mix.
