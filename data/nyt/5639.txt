These are the final days of Output, Brooklyn’s first fully-licensed venue dedicated to house and techno music. The club will close forever on January 1, 2019, the owners said on Facebook.

Output opened in 2013 and quickly landed on “best dance club” lists. With a world-class sound system and strict no-photos policy, it was known for focusing on the music, bringing in house- and techno- heavyweights like Richie Hawtin, Danny Tenaglia, The Martinez Brothers, Seth Troxler, John Digweed and Nicole Moudaber.
