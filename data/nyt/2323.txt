Last Chance

‘APOLOGIA’ at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (closes on Dec. 16). Will you forgive yourself for missing Alexi Kaye Campbell’s play? Stockard Channing stars as Kristin, a celebrated art historian who has a fraught relationship with her adult sons. Ben Brantley called her character “complex, contradictory,” writing that Channing’s excellence compensates for a work that never “moves you as much as it should.”

‘GIRL FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY’ at the Public Theater (closes on Dec. 23). Don’t think twice. This musical by Conor McPherson, which uses the songs of Bob Dylan, will play its final harmonica solo. The setting, Depression-era Minnesota, is grim and so is most of the story, but when these characters sing, Ben Brantley wrote, “they seem to conjure light and warmth out of the cold, cold night that surrounds them.”

‘LEWISTON/CLARKSTON’ at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (closes on Dec. 16). Samuel D. Hunter’s intimate diptych, with a barbecue dinner served in between, ceases its exploration. One play follows a descendant of the expeditioner Meriwether Lewis; the other, of his fellow explorer William Clark. Both are directed by Davis McCallum. Jesse Green called “Lewiston” “lovely but mild” and “Clarkston” “devastating.”
