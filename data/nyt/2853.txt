OXFORD, England — It’s an unlikely way for a hip-hop video to begin. At first, the camera shows us a picture-postcard view of Oxford, the famous English university city, from above: spires, towers, trees and lawns, golden in the morning sun. But then the camera wheels round and a beat begins to pulse. A young man in a yellow hoodie edges toward the camera, spitting out lyrics about poverty, homelessness, police brutality and drug abuse. “A stone’s throw from the city center lies another life,” he raps.

Outsiders might be surprised that Oxford’s streets — generally filled with tourist buses and gown-wearing academics — could ever be classified as mean. But an exhibition that recently opened at the Modern Art Oxford gallery argues otherwise. Entitled “Fantastic Cities,” and devoted to the work of the maverick filmmaker Penny Woolcock, it aims to show Oxford, and the rest of England, in a less flattering light than the clichés usually on offer. Observe the divisions that lie beneath the surface of a city like this, it suggests, and you get some insight into why the United Kingdom is one of the most economically unequal countries in Europe.

Ms. Woolcock, 68, has devoted career life to finding poetry in unexpected places. She first came to attention with her 1997 TV movie “Macbeth on the Estate,” an audacious transposition of the Scottish play to a tough high-rise housing project in Birmingham, England. (Among other tweaks to Shakespeare’s script, it featured a character called “Crackhead’s Sidekick.”) Her subsequent films include a three-part, warts-and-all dramatization of life in another housing project, this time in the northern city of Leeds, made in collaboration with some of its working-class residents.
