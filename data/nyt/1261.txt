Stefan Timmermans, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who researches how people die and how communities grieve, began attending several years ago as part of his work. He has spent time with workers at the medical examiner’s office, diving into files and going on ride-alongs with coroners. But he has kept attending the ceremony because he found it personally meaningful.

“I just find it also very moving and very touching that people come together around this, and there’s something very powerful about stepping up to the plate, taking time from L.A. traffic and your everyday life,” he said. “It contrasts very strongly with the abandonment of these people.”

He said the ceremony was “sort of like an antidote to the isolation and alienation you can have in big cities, which is reflected in the many unclaimed, about 1,500 in L.A. County every year.”

Phillip Gruber, who works in health services for the county, said he had been meaning to come for many years, and finally did this year, “to see how our society finds a way to honor people who have been apart.”

“Our highest ideal is to treat each other with dignity and respect no matter who you are,” he said.

Reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles, there were representatives of many spiritual traditions at the ceremony: Christian, Jewish, Native American, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist. A man with an oboe played Bach, and a choir sang “Amazing Grace.” Those gathered placed flowers on the grave site, on a plot of land that has long been a final resting place for the forgotten of Los Angeles: More than a decade ago, the century-old remains of Chinese laborers were discovered nearby as workers were digging a tunnel for the extension of the city’s subway.

Walking back to the parking lot after the ceremony, Mary Bonderove, who came from Whittier to attend for the first time, had tears in her eyes. “Every life matters,” she said.
