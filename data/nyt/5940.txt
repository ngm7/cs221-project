The N.F.L. regular season concluded Sunday night, a 17-week march that whittled a 32-team league to a 12-team playoff field with an impressive geographic reach. From Seattle to New England, with representatives from multiple regions around the country — including two teams each from Texas and Los Angeles — the dozen teams left standing for the monthlong postseason are a diverse lot.

But that does not mean they are all equal. Not by a long shot.

Recent history suggests the playoffs are stacked in favor of just a few teams. The edge has consistently gone to those who have earned the highest seeds in the A.F.C. and N.F.C. (teams are ranked from one to six by conference). Significantly, a top seeding comes with a prized home field advantage until the Super Bowl as well as a bye in the opening week of the playoffs.

Each of the last five Super Bowl winners began their journey throughout the playoffs as a No. 1 seed. Nine of the 10 teams that played in those Super Bowls were No. 1 seeds.

That would mean that this year’s top seeds, the New Orleans Saints in the N.F.C. and the Kansas City Chiefs in the A.F.C., are the principal favorites this season. And they are.
