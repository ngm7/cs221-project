A lone, fourth-quarter touchdown was enough for the New Orleans Saints to pull off a 12-9 victory against the Carolina Panthers on Monday night.

Drew Brees completed 23 of 35 passes for 203 yards with an interception for the N.F.C. South champion Saints (12-2), who overcame glitches on offense throughout the game. New Orleans can clinch home-field advantage throughout the N.F.C. playoffs by winning one of their final two games.

Carolina (6-8) has lost six straight games, but the Panthers are still holding on to slim playoff hopes.

Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, who was playing with a sore shoulder, finished 16 of 29 for 131 yards and one interception.
