In late June, Walgreens made a $2,500 contribution to the campaign of Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Mississippi Republican. Almost five months later, on Nov. 2., Hyde-Smith made a joke about a “public hanging” that seemed to be a reference to lynching. In the weeks after, many of Hyde-Smith’s corporate donors asked for their money back.

Walgreens has not yet been publicly identified as one of those unhappy donors, but it was. I learned that while reporting on the company for my most recent column. Walgreens’ political action committee sent a letter to Hyde-Smith’s campaign “a day or two in advance of the special runoff election” that Mississippi held on Nov. 27, Brian Faith, a Walgreens executive, told me.

I’m glad Walgreens asked that its donation be returned , even if it did so quietly. But I also think that the request to Hyde-Smith shows why the company’s response to the power grab by Wisconsin Republicans — whom the company has also supported financially — is inadequate.
