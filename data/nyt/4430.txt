AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY

Waking Up From My American Dream

By Julián Castro

225 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $30.

Julián Castro’s story, as he tells it, began in 1922, when his grandmother Victoriana, known to him as Mamo, crossed over the Mexico-United States border as a little girl and planted herself in this country. Mamo and her sister, María, were orphaned during the Mexican Revolution and distant relatives in San Antonio took them in. Mamo had one child, Castro’s mother, Rosie, who was the first in her family to go to college and became a civil rights activist. Later, Castro and his twin brother, Joaquín, would tread almost identical paths: from public schools in San Antonio to Stanford University, then from Harvard Law School into politics. Julián eventually served as Barack Obama’s secretary of housing and urban development. (Joaquín represents Texas’ 20th District in Congress.)

Castro’s memoir, “An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up From My American Dream,” traces this arc, a part of which he first shared in a 2012 Democratic National Convention speech that put him on the public’s radar. Last week, he announced that he was exploring a bid for the presidency in 2020. So far, he is the only potential Latino contender.
