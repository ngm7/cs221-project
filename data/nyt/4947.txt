In a performance filmed at Electric Lady Studios in New York, Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson remake “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” the 1971 plea for peace and reconciliation by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It comes with dynastic approval: their son, Sean Ono Lennon, plays guitar and sings the countermelody — “War is over/if you want it” — by Cyrus’s side. (All three played the song on “Saturday Night Live” last weekend, too.) Ronson backs her with a synthesizer-laced Wall of Sound, complete with bedrock backbeats and sleigh bells, and Cyrus’s earnest belting gets grittier as the backup swells and the harmonies ascend. After her “Merry Christmas” wish and the last reverb dies down, she happily swears. JON PARELES
