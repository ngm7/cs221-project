The story of how Alice S. Kandell discovered Tibetan Buddhist art sounds like the plot of a fanciful movie.

As a Sarah Lawrence College student in the 1960s, she wanted to put Tibet on the itinerary of a class trip, but her parents objected because of unrest related to the Chinese occupation there. A close friend tried, however, and got as far as India.

That friend, Hope Cooke, met the crown prince of Sikkim, which borders Tibet. Eventually, “she married him,” Ms. Kandell said. “She was becoming the queen and invited me to the coronation.”

By then, Ms. Kandell was studying psychology. In asking for leave to go to Sikkim (now part of India), she told her professor the tale. “He said, ‘When fantasy becomes reality, a member of the Harvard psychology department should be there to witness it,’” she recalled.
