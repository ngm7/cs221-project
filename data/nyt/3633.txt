Cameron Magruder has a T-shirt-intensive job. When he sits down to film his humorous videos about sports fans watching games or tracking free agency chaos on social media, he plays every role himself, with each fan character in the appropriate shirt, be it North Texas or Yale.

Can one person really have so many T-shirts? “I have a lot of random T-shirts,” said Magruder, who is known as Scooter. “You’d be surprised.”

Magruder, 30, is one of many people making a living creating videos online. But he is one of the few with a depth of knowledge about sports and dedication to wearing the right shirt that have given him a cult following among fans.

His videos satirizing the sometimes passionate, sometimes angry, sometimes delusional overreacting fan have many millions of views on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
