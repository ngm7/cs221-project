A turbulent year on Wall Street ended with a small gain for stocks on Monday.

The trade war, and its potential to erode corporate profits and slow the economy, has ranked high among investors’ concerns this year, and any indication that tension was ratcheting higher or easing served as a catalyst for swings in stock indexes. The latest was a tweet on Saturday from President Trump in which he said “big progress” was being made in talks between the United States and China.

Still, the overall gains on Monday were small, with the S&P 500 up 0.85 percent. Mr. Trump has in the past made positive statements about China only to reverse course and issue new threats soon after.
