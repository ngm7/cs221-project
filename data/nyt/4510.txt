I traveled with a local photographer, Karolina Jonderko, to the Nikiszowiec neighborhood of Katowice, which was built in 1908 to house local coal miners. After the fall of Communism in the 1990s, many of the nearby mines went out of business. The neighborhood was soon racked by joblessness and crime.

But local leaders banded together to revitalize the area. Today, we found, Nikiszowiec’s charming cobbled streets have become a popular tourist stop; its brick buildings now house artist workshops and young families.

“There’s a strong community here,” said Grzegorz Chudy, 46, a local artist who moved here ten years ago.

Inside the United Nations climate conference a few miles away, politicians and climate experts were talking of the need for a “just transition” away from polluting energy sources, in which workers who lost their jobs were able to find new livelihoods. Nikiszowiec seemed like a plausible demonstration of how that might work in practice.

Yet there was still more to the story. Even as Katowice was installing long arrays of solar panels around town, the city was still getting most of its electricity from a giant coal-fired plant nearby that coated the air with a thick smog on many days. The city ranks as one of Europe’s 50 most polluted, and a recent study found that the fouled air is decreasing life spans here by 1.5 years.
