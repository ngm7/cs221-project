In the early years of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which had its first induction ceremony in 1986, the winners were unquestioned gods of the genre, like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and the Beatles. But since at least 2007, when hip-hop finally arrived via Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the hall has been the focus of continual debate about the makeup — or even the existence — of a rock canon.

This year’s crop is unlikely to stir much controversy, unlike the recent inductions of Kiss, Bon Jovi or Journey, who, despite their success, have long been reviled by many critics and other gatekeepers on the hall’s secretive nominating committee.

The inclusion of Radiohead and Jackson should please some of the hall’s detractors. Radiohead’s snub last year mystified many observers who saw other 1990s alternative heroes like Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Green Day enter the hall the instant they became eligible. And the absence of Jackson, who had been rejected twice before, was seen as symbolic of the underrepresentation of women and people of color. In a statement, Jackson said, “I am truly honored and I am happy to be in there with my brothers,” the members of the Jackson 5, who were inducted in 1997. (Michael Jackson was also inducted as a solo artist in 2001.)

Nicks, who was already in the hall as a member of Fleetwood Mac, has been recognized for her solo career. She will be the first female multiple inductee, joining more than 20 men, including Michael Jackson, Lou Reed and each Beatle.
