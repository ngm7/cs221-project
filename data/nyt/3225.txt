Re “Cohen Gets 3 Years in Prison for ‘Smorgasbord of Fraudulent Conduct’” (news article, Dec. 13):

Michael Cohen’s 36-month prison sentence is obscene. He’s not the good guy he tried to paint himself as in court, just a family guy who went momentarily astray. Aside from the charges against him, Mr. Cohen is also the man who violently threatened a journalist during the 2016 election campaign for asking a question about Donald Trump’s first marriage.

He is the man who retweeted that the journalist Megyn Kelly should be gutted after her questioning of Mr. Trump during the campaign. He is the man who helped Mr. Trump perpetuate a fraud on the American people, who lied to Congress and who later sold access to the president. Mr . Cohen’s actions have been an attack on our democracy and have harmed us all.

Even in this plea agreement, Mr. Cohen has not come clean. He has refused to sign a full cooperation agreement, which means he’s not telling all he knows. For these reasons it is clear: Michael Cohen did not deserve the leniency he got; his sentence of 36 months is an affront to all Americans and our system of justice.

Re “President Lays Out a Defense Against Potential Campaign-Finance Charges” (news article, Dec. 11):

Here’s a question for President Trump: If, as he claims, Michael Cohen’s payoffs (at the president’s direction) to two women were perfectly legal, “a simple private transaction ,” why on earth would (1) Mr. Cohen admit that they were felonies (as he has), and (2) a federal court sentence him to three years in prison for his role in them (as it just did)?
