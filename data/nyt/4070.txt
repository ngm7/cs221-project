‘A VERY JEWISH CHRISTMAS’ at Gotham Comedy Club (Dec. 24, 7 and 9 p.m.). The night before Christmas doesn’t have to remain church-mouse quiet for all of our Jewish New Yorker friends and neighbors, among them many funny comedians. Sam Morril, who hosted MSG’s “People Talking Sports” and released a Comedy Central special this year, will perform with Marion Grodin, James Goff and Jared Freid.

MELISSA VILLASEÑOR at Carolines on Broadway (Dec. 20, 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 21-22, 7:30 and 10 p.m.). In her third season as a cast member on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” Villaseñor can uncork uncanny impersonations not only of actors such as Sarah Silverman, Kathy Griffin and Owen Wilson, but also of singers like Gwen Stefani, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Celine Dion. And that’s just scratching the surface of her talent. See and hear what she can do when she has the whole show to herself.
