Fantastical Beasts Take Over the Bass

For their first solo museum show, now open at the Bass Museum, Nikolai and Simon Haas — the Los Angeles-based artists-cum-designers also known as the Haas Brothers — have created a menagerie of their signature whimsical beasts, arranged throughout an immersive forestlike environment. Titled “Ferngully,” after the 1992 animated children’s film, the exhibition incorporates furniture, sculpture and objets d’art crafted from Icelandic sheepskin, curly cow fur, chocolate goat fur, carved ebony and cast bronze. “This show is a physical journal of the last seven years,” Simon Haas told T. Visitors are also able to take home an otherworldly creation of their own; the lifestyle brand L’Objet has worked with the artists to create a limited edition of objects for the home, including handcrafted porcelain plates, Mojave palm-scented candles and a hand-etched gold-plated stationary box — all available at a pop-up shop within the museum.

“Ferngully” is on view now through April 21, 2019, at the Bass Museum, 2100 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, thebass.org.
