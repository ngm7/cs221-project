NEW ORLEANS — The N.B.A. has earned a term that its commissioner had not heard.

“How does it feel to be the wokest professional sports league?” asked Marc Lacey, the national editor at The New York Times.

“I didn’t know we were given that designation,” Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said, laughing. “But I understand the sentiment and we’re proud of that.”

That feeling was front and center at the Cities for Tomorrow conference here, with politicians, educators, policymakers and others discussing their influence on their communities. In the past few years, the N.B.A. has found itself in the spotlight for the way its players and teams have spoken out on social and political issues both locally and nationally.
