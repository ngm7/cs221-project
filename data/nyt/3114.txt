MOSCOW — Russian state television hailed it as “one of the most advanced robots,” showing a tall, white android dancing clumsily to a catchy tune. It seemed so human.

There was a good reason:It was just a man in a robot costume.

In the television report, the robot, called Boris, spoke slowly with a very synthetic voice.

“I know mathematics well, but I also want to know how to draw and write music!” Boris said in a report broadcast on Tuesday by the state-owned Rossiya-24 news channel. His eyes flashed mysteriously.
