What began as a bat mitzvah project has turned into multiple visits a month to the center, where Alexa puts on activities like craft projects and board games. The work has meant so much to her that she now leads 15 teenage volunteers — and has convinced her mom to come and help too. Alexa has rarely missed a visit in 5 years.

“I need to teach them about trust,” she says. “If I say I’m going to be here, I’m going to stick to my word.”

The center is run by JCCA, formerly the Jewish Child Care Association, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation New York, which receives funds from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Founded in 1911, The Times’s fund raises money for people of all ages and backgrounds.
