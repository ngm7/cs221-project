MS. GONZALEZ I don’t want to minimize the fact that newspapers in this country are facing a serious threat, but I’d like to say that we’re so good at telling our own stories — a little too good in this instance. We write so much about the issues that newspapers face. But left out of the conversation is the fact that the same digital upheaval that is impacting us is impacting television and cable and the music industry. Technology is disrupting everyone.

The key is how are we responding to that disruption. It requires a creative realignment of how you approach what you do. I think the essence of what we do is so critical, I think we have to figure out how we keep doing what we do. I cannot imagine the city like Miami without The Miami Herald to hold our elected leaders and the powerful accountable.
