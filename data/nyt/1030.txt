Osmo Vanska, the conductor who made the Minnesota Orchestra a formidable musical force and bucked tradition by siding with its players during a bitter lockout, announced on Wednesday that he would step down as its music director in 2022.

His departure, which will come after 19 seasons, will close an eventful chapter in the orchestra’s history — one of strong artistic growth, followed by the near-death experience of a 16-month lockout and, after it ended in 2014, by continuing efforts to heal, rebuild and grow.

Torn between the musicians they work with and the boards and administrations they work for, music directors typically avoid taking sides in labor disputes. But Mr. Vanska made his support of the musicians increasingly clear as the long lockout stretched on.

“I felt that it was my orchestra, and I had to take care of it, whatever happens,” he recalled in a telephone interview. “I just felt the players were handled very unfairly.”
