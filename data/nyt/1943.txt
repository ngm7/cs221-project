Many of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren’t particularly holiday-focused.

We dug up 10 of those reviews from our archives, which we’ve rounded up here, along with info on where to stream them. Below is how the critic Vincent Canby reviewed “Gremlins” for The New York Times on June 8, 1984:

THE star of “Gremlins” is none of the perfectly adequate actors in the cast but the mogwai, a small, furry, fictitious creature that looks something like a cuddly teddy bear with the ears of a rabbit, a Bambilike nose, eyes as round and deep and dark as glass buttons, a sweet disposition and a physical nature more unstable than hydrogen gas.

At the beginning of the film, when Rand Peltzer, an unsuccessful inventor, buys a mogwai in San Francisco’s Chinatown as a Christmas present for his family, he is warned to keep the creature away from direct light, never to allow it to have contact with water and, above all, never feed it after midnight. Bluebeard’s instructions to his foolish wives couldn’t have been any more specific.

Rand returns home to Kingston Falls, U.S.A., a perfect movie set of a town, where the plastic snow never melts and where, you can be sure, they start playing Christmas carols the day after the Fourth of July. In this comically idealized setting, it’s just a matter of time before each of the mogwai prohibitions has been broken, with grotesque results that nearly destroy Kingston Falls as well as the movie.
