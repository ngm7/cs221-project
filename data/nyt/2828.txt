Re “Trump Has Allies on Fossil Fuels” (front page, Dec. 11):

President Trump’s climate adviser, Wells Griffith, clarified something important on Monday during climate talks in Poland. It’s not that he and his ilk don’t get the dangers of heating up the planet to the breaking point. They just don’t care.

“We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability,” Mr . Griffith said. Whatever they want, they see as fair game. And therein lies the danger of this greedy and reckless administration.

Re “Scientists Warn of a ‘Rapid Unraveling’ of the Arctic” (news article, Dec. 12):

How many more carefully researched reports will need to be released before we finally act in a substantive way to protect our only home, planet Earth? Politicians may choose to ignore these findings, as most Republicans will, but nature won’t stop changing just because these dire warnings are dismissed.

Although I do all I can to reduce my carbon footprint, this is not nearly enough to protect my family and community from the effects of climate change. We need the help of courageous political leaders to address climate change before it’s too late. Laws need to be enacted now to reduce our energy use and protect us from the ravages of rising seas, increased temperatures and more intense storms.
