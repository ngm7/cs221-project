THE 41ST ANNUAL KENNEDY CENTER HONORS 8 p.m. on CBS. In September, the singer Cher told The New York Times that her “favorite thing in the world is to rehearse.” The same month, the composer and saxophonist Wayne Shorter told The Times that he and his quartet “never rehearse anything.” Both creative methods have worked. This month Cher and Shorter, along with the country singer Reba McEntire and the composer Philip Glass, were the honorees at the 41st Annual Kennedy Center Awards, where the singer Gloria Estefan hosted a celebration of the four artists. The creators of “Hamilton” — Lin-Manuel Miranda, the director Thomas Kail, the choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler and the music director Alex Lacamoire — also received a special honor. The event includes tributes from Cyndi Lauper, Kelly Clarkson, Whoopi Goldberg and some of the original “Hamilton” cast members.
