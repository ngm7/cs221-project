Alyson Cambridge made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004 when she was 24. She has performed there regularly ever since while also appearing on European stages with the Polish National Opera and the Munich Philharmonic. This year, Ms. Cambridge, 39, made her Broadway debut in the musical “Rocktopia” and released her third album, “Sisters in Song,” a collaboration with her longtime friend and colleague Nicole Cabell. The album is a mix of opera duets, classical songs and African-American spirituals. She lives on the Upper West Side.

CAFFEINATE On a typical Sunday off, I sleep till 10. As an opera singer, I perform late and don’t get home until midnight and am usually wide-awake. By the time I actually sleep, it’s 2 a.m., so 10 is not really sleeping in, but I like to get the day started. I can’t function without coffee so the first thing I do is make a giant pot and drink it in a big mug with unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I watch “Meet the Press” while I sip.
