LIVERPOOL, England — Jordan Henderson had just sent a shot, wild and high and a little comical, soaring into orbit above Arsenal’s crossbar. The ball landed somewhere in the upper rows of the Kop, its arrival greeted with a teasing cheer. Henderson turned, apologized to his teammates and jogged back into position.

As he did so, Liverpool’s fans serenaded the ball back down to earth, asking — in less than gentle terms — what, exactly, their captain had been intending to do. Henderson paused, turned toward them and lifted his arms in the air, as if in triumph. He beamed a wide smile. The crowd laughed at him, with him.

The situation allowed for a little levity. Liverpool was leading, 5-1, with just a few minutes left to play; everyone involved had, for some time, been going through the motions, conserving energy, watching the clock.

A ninth successive Premier League win was secure. Liverpool’s unbeaten start to the season would go on. Tottenham Hotspur’s defeat at home to Wolves a few hours previously meant that Jürgen Klopp’s team would have a 9-point lead at the top of the table, for 24 hours, at least; by that stage, Anfield was feeling lighthearted, lightheaded.
