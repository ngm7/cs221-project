Mr. Sanchez said in the statement that he was “disappointed that the article failed to show the number of lives we’ve changed with the significant number of reunifications, and it failed to highlight the good work we do within our schools and our juvenile justice programs.” But he added that the article “brought forth a number of issues that are of concern to me.”

In a memo to staff on Monday, he said that anyone asked to participate in the review, including himself and Ms. Chung, would cooperate fully or “face immediate consequences.”

But the independence and thoroughness of the investigation will depend on the person leading it, said Lloyd Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame Law School specializing in nonprofit law.

“It can be difficult as the outside investigator to write a hard-hitting report to slam the very person who seems to be driving the process,” Professor Mayer said. “Everyone knows who is paying the bills and what the desired response is.”

The inquiry comes as the federal government steps up scrutiny of shelter providers, hiring an accounting firm to review their finances. That review is underway, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said. The F.B.I. is also investigating a former competitor of Southwest Key, the Texas-based International Educational Services, for potential misuse of federal money, according to two people informed of the inquiry.
