To the Editor:

Re “May Retains Post, but E.U. Exit Plan Faces Bleak Path” (front page, Dec. 13):

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain speaks of “delivering the Brexit that people voted for.” But the Brexit that people voted for was always an impossible fantasy premised on false assurances that they could, as Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, famously put it, both have their cake and eat it.

Now that an increasing number of the British are waking up to reality, I hope that their leaders will give them a second chance to vote on Brexit with their eyes wide open.
