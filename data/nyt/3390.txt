Justice has arrived — in one sense, that is.

No, Robert Mueller has not concluded his wide-ranging 18-month investigation into Russia’s influence on the 2016 presidential election, and sweeping criminal justice legislation has not yet come up for a vote on Capitol Hill. But the dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster on Monday selected “justice” as its word of the year, inspired by 12 long months of news headlines about the obstruction of justice, the Department of Justice and a certain Supreme Court justice, not to mention high-profile debates over racial and social justice (or the lack thereof).

In choosing the noun, Merriam-Webster said “justice” was looked up on its website a whopping 74 percent more often this year than in 2017. Searches for the term spiked following news stories that featured the word, the company said, often involving the Justice Department, which is overseeing the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling.

“For many reasons and for many meanings, one thing’s for sure: justice has been on the minds of many people in 2018,” the company said in a statement, explaining that the word, often as a concept or used as a legal term, “was at the center of many of our national debates in the past year.”

Defining an entire year of politics and culture by one word is, of course, an inexact science. Oxford Dictionaries chose “toxic” as its word of the year. Dictionary.com went with “misinformation.”
