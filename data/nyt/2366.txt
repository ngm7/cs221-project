Why?

It’s fast. There’s a ton of vocabulary, they’re on point the entire time and there are only 12 people in it. New York City Ballet has hundreds. [Laughs] Not every ballerina’s in every act, but our guys are.

You joined Trockadero as a dancer in 1980. What was the culture like?

Dancing in drag was not considered something that respectable people did. Everyone told me not to do it — it was considered a career wrecker. Now it’s completely a career choice.

It was really disorganized. We were basically told to shut up and get out there. When I became the director, I thought I’m going to do two things: get organized and be nice. You can say the same thing in a harsh tone or a positive tone, and I’ve gotten good at saying things very nicely. It’s very exhausting.

How do you get through it?

I go home, and I kick my dog. I’m kidding. I don’t have a dog.

How did the company cope during the AIDS crisis?

Being a company made up exclusively of gay men, except for some of the management, it was horrifying. We almost closed around 1990. But it also did kind of free us up.
