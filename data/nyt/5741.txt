EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Somewhere in the outer regions of the MetLife Stadium parking lot, Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur and strategist better known to his legions of devoted Twitter followers and YouTube subscribers as Gary Vee, gathered some friends for a pregame huddle.

Or maybe it was a prayer circle.

“O.K., bring it in,” he said in a hushed voice.

The 12 men wrapped arms and locked eyes. One by one, they predicted the final score and a key play of the game. And because they were all Jets fans, the overwhelming expectation on this damp December afternoon was that the Jets would lose.

In fact, Vaynerchuk was hoping for it.

“I want them to get a high draft pick,” he said. “Any real fan should want the same thing.”

Know this: Vaynerchuk, 43, is a real fan, and he has been since the New York Sack Exchange team in 1982. He might prove this by casually referencing the former wide receiver Wallace Wright (career receptions: eight). He also owns a Thomas Hennessy jersey. That’s the current team’s long snapper.
