For an owner who wants to enter a yacht in the Rolex Sydney Hobart race, the procedure is relatively straightforward. Sign the forms. Meet the safety and medical requirements. Pay the entry fee.

When Stacey Jackson was first interested in doing this year’s race, she did not even have a boat.

But she did have a plan and the conviction that the time was right for a professional team of women with an ecological message focused on ocean health. Jackson and her 12 Ocean Respect Racing crewmates are now aboard Wild Oats X for one of yachting’s great spectacles: the annual 628-nautical-mile sprint from Sydney to Tasmania.

“To send a message you need a good voice, and nothing brings attention more to a boat than a unique concept on the crew,” said Jackson, a 35-year-old Australian who is the skipper of Ocean Respect. “I’m too old to do a youth crew, so I said, ‘Let’s do an all-female team again but do it at a different level than it’s been done in the past.’”

To better understand what it takes to do the Sydney Hobart Race, The New York Times is focusing on different roles within Ocean Respect’s crew: skipper, bowman and navigator.
