It’s been more than a week since Kevin Hart was announced as host of the 91st Oscars ceremony and then stepped down in response to criticism over homophobic Twitter posts. The Motion Picture Academy still hasn’t found a replacement.

That’s because it’s a thankless job. As a recent “Saturday Night Live” skit put it: “Who will risk everything for the chance to gain nothing?” No wonder many celebrities would rather not put their reputations on the line when the gig draws so much criticism.

While there’s a chance the academy will go on with no one at all, the world hasn’t given up just yet. Many stars have suggested names. Some have even nominated themselves. If the academy had to choose a host, here are the brave people who would be happy to take up the challenge.
