A four-foot bronze statue of a girl sporting a defiant look on her face appeared in Lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women’s Day in March 2017. The sculpture soon became known as the Fearless Girl, captivating New Yorkers and tourists alike.

On Monday, the Fearless Girl did as most New York transplants do after their first year in the city: She moved to more permanent digs, several blocks north, opposite the New York Stock Exchange.

“We are welcoming her with open arms,” Betty Liu, executive vice chairwoman of the exchange, which appointed its first female president in 226 years in May, said in an interview on Monday.

The 250-pound statue was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a Boston-based financial firm, and placed in front of the Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street last year to draw attention to “the power of women in leadership.”
