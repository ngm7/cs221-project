WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The man accused of murdering a British backpacker in New Zealand the night before her 22nd birthday made his first appearance in the Auckland District Court on Monday, where the judge expressed sympathy to the victim’s family for their “desperate” grief.

The backpacker, Grace Millane, was last seen entering a downtown hotel with the man in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, on Dec. 1. The police discovered a body on the western outskirts of the city Sunday and said they believed it was the missing woman; a formal identification is expected this week.

The accused, 26, whose name cannot be reported because his lawyer is still fighting to have details of his identity suppressed, was arrested on Saturday night and remains in custody after Monday’s court appearance.

Although the hearing was a preliminary formality — such cases in New Zealand typically take around a year to come to trial — the court’s public gallery was packed and the presiding judge took the unusual step of directly addressing Ms. Millane’s father and uncle, who arrived from England last week.
