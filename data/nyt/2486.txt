IRVING, Tex. — After more than a week of criticism over its handling of an investigation of another player caught on video assaulting a woman, the N.F.L. on Wednesday doubled down on its policy of refusing to pay for footage or other evidence when investigating off-field conduct.

In response to a question at a meeting of league owners about the recent case involving former Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, the N.F.L.’s chief disciplinary officer said that the league did not want to buy surveillance videos from public places or residences because it could prompt people to try to take compromising videos of players or officials with the intent of selling it to the N.F.L., or to try to sell doctored videos.

“To become mercenary and pay for video opens up a Pandora’s box of all kinds of opportunities and things that may come to us,” B. Todd Jones, the N.F.L.’s special counsel for conduct, said.

Jones’s comments were the first from a league official since The New York Times reported on Friday that league officials had questioned Hunt this fall about an altercation at an Ohio resort that occurred in June but neglected to ask him about an apparent assault of a woman that happened in February.
