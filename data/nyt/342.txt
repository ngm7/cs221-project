Re “Trump Appoints China Hard-Liner for Trade Talks” (front page, Dec. 4):

I agree that China’s “push to obtain trade secrets and intellectual property” must be addressed. However, that should have been specifically targeted, and preferably in conjunction with our allies.

Trade wars are not “easy to win ,” despite what President Trump has claimed, and “winning” is not when our side merely loses less than the other party. Meanwhile, the tariffs are an indirect tax increase on consumers and hurt many of our productive sectors.

Mr. Trump started this all-out trade war, and now wants to be a hero by not accelerating it further?

Vitally important stakes in these trade negotiations between the United States and China go beyond tariffs, nontariff barriers, technology transfer, intellectual property and cyber intrusion.
