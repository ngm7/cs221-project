Stocks rose on Wall Street Monday after President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce in the trade war between the United States and China.

The S&P 500-stock index climbed 1.1 percent, notching its fifth gain in the last six trading sessions. Major Asian and European equity markets also posted solid increases.

Exporting giants like Boeing, Caterpillar and Deere pulled the export-reliant S&P 500 industrial sector higher. Semiconductor makers, which have been hurt by the trade war’s potential to disrupt their widespread production networks in Asia, also rose, as did tech giants such as Apple, which climbed more than 3 percent.

Still, market gains were tempered by doubts that the fragile cease-fire — essentially a 90-day postponement of additional American tariffs on Chinese imports — would put the dispute between the world’s two largest economies to rest permanently.
