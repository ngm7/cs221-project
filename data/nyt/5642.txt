In 1920, Conan Doyle, now long famous as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, received a letter from an excited friend who was in possession of a photograph in which tiny females with diaphanous wings are cavorting in front of an entranced adolescent girl. The girl was 16-year-old Elsie Wright, who lived near the village of Cottingley in Yorkshire, and the photo had been taken by her 10-year-old cousin, Frances. The girls reported having previously seen the fairies by a stream and then gone back with a camera borrowed from Elsie’s father so Frances could take a picture of her with the mystical creatures.

Had Sherlock Holmes seen that initial image, he would no doubt have noticed that although a breeze had caused the leaves on the trees to blur, the wings of the flying fairies showed no movement. Conan Doyle, however, regarded the photograph as genuine. When more photographs of fairies showed up the same year, he wrote two articles and a nonfiction book, “The Coming of the Fairies,” in which he insisted that the figures depicted were actual fairies. His belief earned him condemnation from the press, the public and, ironically, Christian churches, whose own belief system encompassed winged angels and devils.
