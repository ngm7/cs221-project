SEOUL, South Korea â€” As if air travel did not have enough nuisances, some K-pop fans have invented a new one: They board planes just to get a closer look at their favorite stars and then disembark, canceling their flights just before the gate closes.

Screaming fans jostling each other to take a peek at South Korean K-pop stars have become a regular scene at airports across Asia. But recently, some have become bolder, booking first-class seats that get them near enough to snap pictures and ask for autographs in VIP lounges or aboard the planes themselves. They then leave the flight and cancel their ticket.

These fans have caused disruptions at several Asian airports recently, and the incidents have angered passengers and airline officials alike: Security regulations require all passengers to leave the plane and repeat security checks whenever anyone voluntarily leaves a flight before takeoff.

On Saturday, a Korean Air flight from Hong Kong to Incheon International Airport, which serves Seoul, was delayed for an hour because three fans boarded to get a glimpse at the boy band Wanna One. About 360 other passengers also had to leave the plane with their carry-on luggage.
