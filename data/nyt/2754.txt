The Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated classics include “My Neighbor Totoro,” “Princess Mononoke” and the Oscar-winning “Spirited Away,” is an artist sufficiently painstaking as to be called tortured. As such, he has announced his retirement more than once over the course of his four-decade career. But after he finished the 2013 feature “The Wind Rises,” Miyazaki, now 77, seemed intent on putting a stop to his work. In 2014 he shut down his offices at Studio Ghibli, the animated film company he co-founded in 1985.

After a prologue laying all this out, “Never-Ending Man: Hayao Miyazaki,” a documentary directed by Kaku Arakawa made in 2016 and having its New York theatrical premiere this week, finds the maestro in a sparsely-furnished house referred to as his “atelier,” brewing coffee, brooding and sketching.
