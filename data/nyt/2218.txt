Re “Clash on Camera as Trump Warns of a Shutdown” (front page, Dec. 12):

In a rare moment of transparency, President Trump allowed the nation to witness his deal-making skills and negotiating prowess when he invited the media to a discussion on border security with two Democratic leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. And what a disturbing show it was.

What we learned is that the president operates like a child, demanding that he gets what he wants or else. If his wants are rejected, then there is a temper tantrum, or, in this case, the threat of a government shutdown. That is not negotiation. That is not compromise. That does not even qualify as a discussion.

What it does do, and he knows it, is look like toughness to his base, which he has shown time after time to be the only thing he cares about. The rest of the country? We’re on our own.

Our president declares that he will be “proud to shut down the government ” if he doesn’t get his wall. It won’t take long to discover if this is the straw that breaks through the silence and hibernating consciences of congressional Republicans.
