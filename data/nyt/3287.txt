Every year I send Christmas cards. A little bell goes off in my head reminding me to write greetings to friends, family and colleagues, wishing them well for the holidays and the new year. Often my messages are rather dull and unoriginal, I’ll admit. But I always spend a little more time when writing the card to my older brother.

I actually send him two cards. One goes to the prison that he is in. The other, which includes a cashier’s check, goes to a lockbox in a different state for his commissary. It never gets any easier to write to my brother at this time of year, or to fully take in how such a small act of kindness can mean so much to someone who feels so forgotten and alone.

I thought about my brother while reading the news this week about the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that, after months of stalling, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, finally agreed to put up for a vote before Christmas. It has bipartisan support and, as the name suggests, is by no means comprehensive.
