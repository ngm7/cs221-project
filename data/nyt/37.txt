Good morning. I loved this Gabrielle Hamilton column in The Times the other day, about quiche Lorraine and the pleasures of work. Gabrielle’s recipe for the dish (above) is not what you’d call a walk in the park. But attend to the details, and you’ll receive a stunner of a pie in return: the platonic ideal of quiche.

Eat that quiche for lunch tomorrow, and you’ll reap the benefits of your labor. Or serve it to others, and enjoy a rarer fruit: the feeling that you’ve just, with your craft, allowed someone to experience art. That’s a nice feeling, one that’ll bring you back to the kitchen again and again.

But perhaps you were just looking for something to serve the kids tonight after this nightmare first day of the week that had you taking depositions for 10 hours, reviewing the endless widget orders that came in over the weekend, assaying the rat’s nest of wiring you’ll need to tear out and replace if this client’s to have smart thermostats by Christmas. Well. Baked chicken tenders at your service, with sweet potato “fries”!

Or maybe you need some Hanukkah fare. I like Melissa Clark’s celery root and parsnip latkes and Joan Nathan’s recipe for doro wat, a spicy one-pan chicken dish that some Ethiopian Jews put at the center of their holiday tables. Also kugel. And babka and yet more babka.
