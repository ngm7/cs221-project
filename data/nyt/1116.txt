The first couple of intercepts were straightforward because they were near aid stations or on paved roads. But after Tahoe City, the route veers away from populated areas for some time.

I hiked in a few miles to a beautiful overlook on the Tahoe Rim Trail and waited for Courtney at about Mile 32. She arrived shockingly early, at a very fast pace. I snapped a couple of frames as she passed and then she was suddenly a dozen yards ahead. I ran to catch up — careening over rocks, slaloming through pines — and never did. She was too fast.

I couldn’t fathom how she was going to run 200 miles like this.

I tried the same strategy a couple more times over the next 60-ish miles, and the result was always the same. I’d get a couple of quick photos as she passed by and then she was gone. I was stunned by her pace.
