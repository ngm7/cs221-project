Re “Loneliness Is Tearing America Apart,” by Arthur C. Brooks (Op-Ed, Nov. 24):

We agree. In 2009, when we wrote “The Lonely American,” we were deeply troubled that Americans had fewer confidants than in the past, and almost 25 percent reported that they had not talked about matters of importance with anyone in the last six months. We speculated that many people felt beleaguered by the growing demands for more productivity and longer hours at work, side by side with greater job insecurity, and so they retreated after work, putting less effort into their connections with friends and neighbors.

In order to form a community where you live, you need to stay in one place longer than a year or two and create joint projects with others whom you see weekly or bimonthly to achieve that mission. This can be as simple as a car pool, or as complicated as a community chorus. But if you stick with it long enough, it will result in long-term friendships.

This is the simple intentional way that people can create the building blocks of community where they actually live. And a real community, like Senator Ben Sasse’s hometown, Fremont, Neb., cited by Mr. Brooks, draws in and looks after the lonely people who are otherwise seduced by the illusion of connection offered by extremists on the internet.
