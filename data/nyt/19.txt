FINDING JOY on Acorn TV. This six-part Irish comedy series written and created by Amy Huberman (“Striking Out”), who also stars, follows the postbreakup blues of Joy, an uptight woman who tries to keep her orderly life intact after her long-term boyfriend leaves her. That plan quickly goes off the rails when she is promoted and has to fill in for a popular Irish vlogger, Flora the Happy Hunter. The role thrusts Joy out into the world and forces her to find happiness in all sorts of unpredictable, nerve-racking ways.
