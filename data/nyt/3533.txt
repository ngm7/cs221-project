Kathleen Meagher Ughetta and Andrew James Wood were married Dec. 15 at the Lake Placid Lodge in Lake Placid, N.Y. The Rev. John R. Yonkovig, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.

The bride, 26, is an oncology certified nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She was until May 2018 a home hospice nurse with Calvary Hospice in New York. She has a bachelor of arts in global studies from the University of North Carolina and a bachelor of science in nursing from Johns Hopkins University.

She is the daughter of Richard L. Ughetta of Chatham, N.J., and the late Suzanne Hanlon Ughetta.

The groom, 25, is a senior consultant with the treasury advisory group of Deloitte & Touche in New York. He also graduated from the University of North Carolina. He is a son of Laurie Campbell Wood of York, S.C., and Todd K. Wood of Chatham.

Ms. Ughetta and Mr. Wood met on a set of monkey bars at Lafayette Avenue Elementary School in Chatham, and their relationship was set in motion when he asked to hold her hand at their schoolâ€™s fifth-grade roller-skating party. Later that school year during one very memorable recess, they shared a first kiss.
