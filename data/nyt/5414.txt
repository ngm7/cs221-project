Turning their lobbies, pools, bars and rooftops into concert venues lets hotels bring music-scene energy on-site. Some are following the example of festivals like Coachella by hosting days-long events, while other are throwing one-time intimate concerts. Here, some of the hotels that have music events planned in 2019.

1. Kimpton Hotels

Kimpton Hotels started its live music series, K impton Off the Record, in June. The hotel brand has seven intimate performances of no more than 200 guests slated for 2019. Performers are chosen based on how well they complement the hotel’s locale. In August, for example, the indie-pop band St. Lucia will perform at the Kimpton Goodland Hotel in Goleta, Calif. — a hotel with its own vinyl record shop and record players in every room. Performances will also take place in Austin, Tex., Nashville, San Francisco, Toronto, Boston and Los Angeles.

2. Ace Hotel

Ace Hotel isn’t new to the festival scene. Every April for the last decade, the Ace Hotel & Swim Club in Palm Springs, Calif., has hosted the Desert Gold festival. The 2019 version will take place from April 12 to April 21. Performers haven’t been finalized, but in past years Blood Orange and Florence Welch have performed at the hotel. The New Orleans Ace will host its fourth Six of Saturns festival from April 26 to May 5. The chain’s newest festival, Double Vision, was held at Ace Hotel Chicago in July for the first time in 2018 and will be back in the coming year. All the festivals take place poolside, on rooftops, in bars, private event spaces and, in New Orleans, at its in-hotel music venue, Three Keys.
