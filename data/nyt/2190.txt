Jay Gatsby (né James Gatz) came from North Dakota. The actress Carrie Wheeler was Caroline Meeber — or just Sister Carrie — back home in Wisconsin. By the time they each hit it big in New York, they’d wiped out their former identities and shed a fair share of attachments as well.

But they’ve got nothing on Undine Barnes Calles.

Undine’s family, way back in Brooklyn, knew her as Sharona Watkins. After disappearing from their lives to become a fierce public relations diva, she didn’t shed them so much as expunge them, telling everyone they’d died in a fire.

So goes the classic American reinvention story as repurposed by Lynn Nottage in “Fabulation, or the Re-Education of Undine,” which opened on Monday at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The production itself is a reinvention, or at least a revival; writing about its premiere at Playwrights Horizons in 2004, Ben Brantley called it a “busy, robustly entertaining comedy.”

It still is, but the world around it has changed so much that the comedy feels, if just as busy, less robust. Especially at the beginning, when we meet the 37-year-old Undine (Cherise Boothe) at the precipice of a disaster that will start her downward spiral, the play’s tone seems somehow too blithe for the times.
