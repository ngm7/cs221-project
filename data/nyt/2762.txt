In a world of fast-moving trends and touch screens, finding a unique gift that holds a child’s attention without annoying their parents can be a tall order.

Add a vague obligation to choose something educational or wholesome, and it’s easy to see why this simple task paralyzes otherwise decisive adults. Thankfully, the parenting team here at Wirecutter has had a lot of experience both giving and receiving gifts for children of all ages. Here are some ideas that are sure to please.

Infants and toddlers (ages 1 to 3)

At this age, babies and toddlers may struggle to speak, but that doesn’t mean they don’t know what’s going on. In a New York Times Op-Ed, developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik explained that young children learn through play, much in the way scientists learn by doing experiments.

In the same way, preschoolers can get the most benefit (and enjoyment) from toys that also teach them about how the world works. With that in mind, games that encourage pattern matching but don’t depend on numbers or words are a great way to encourage logical thinking among toddlers.
