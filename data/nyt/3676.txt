When I became the Times crossword editor in 1993, the payment rate for contributors was $40 for a weekday puzzle and $150 for a Sunday. These amounts were embarrassingly low, but they were in line with what other “elite” publications were paying. Traditionally, crossword construction has not been a very lucrative field.

Over the years, these rates have increased numerous times. The Times currently pays $300 to $450 for weekday puzzles and $1,000 to $1,200 for Sundays. These are by far the best rates of any open market for puzzles, but they still don’t truly reflect the time, effort and skill involved in producing high-quality work.

It now brings me pleasure to announce that, starting Jan. 1, The Times will be increasing its rates again. For a constructor’s first to 10th crosswords published in the paper, the new rates will be:

Daily: $500

Sunday: $1,500

Beginning with the constructor’s 11th crossword, the rates will be:

Daily: $750

Sunday: $2,250

The two-tiered scale began several years ago. Its purpose is to reward the most reliable contributors and to encourage them to contribute more often. It’s also a recognition that, generally speaking, puzzles from regular contributors require less editorial time and effort.

Unlike many other publications, The Times maintains an open submissions policy, which means that anyone can send in a puzzle for review. (Our specifications are here.) Joel Fagliano, Sam Ezersky and I look at every submission, and everyone gets a response.
