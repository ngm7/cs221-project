BANGKOK — The trip to Thailand was meant to be a belated honeymoon for a young soccer player and his wife.

But upon landing at a Bangkok airport last week, Hakeem al-Araibi, a political refugee from Bahrain playing for a soccer team in Melbourne, Australia, was detained by Thai immigration authorities, who have been asked to extradite him to Bahrain, where he said he had been tortured.

“Please, I am afraid if I go to Bahrain, I will be tortured again,” Mr. Araibi said by phone from an immigration detention center in Bangkok.

At a court hearing on Friday, Mr. Araibi was served with a formal arrest warrant that paves the way for a possible extradition next week. He has the right to appeal Bahrain’s extradition request.
