WHEN HE’S SANTA I really enjoy meeting new people, both young and old, from all over the world and getting to hear their Christmas wishes when they come visit me. One very poignant memory I have is of a man who hesitated in front of the platform on which I sit. Eventually he motioned to me during a lull in the activities, and I stepped down to see what he wanted. He had a St. Christopher’s medal that he asked me to bless for his mother, who was terminally ill and couldn’t come to the park. I clutched the medal he was holding and said a Baha’i prayer. He was profoundly grateful and turned back with tears in his eyes, as did I. I really spooked one young man by calling out to him by name. “How did you know?” he started to ask, before realizing that his name was embroidered on his shirt.
