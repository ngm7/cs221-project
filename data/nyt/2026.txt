1. Wanted: A new White House chief of staff.

The hunt is on after President Trump announced over the weekend that John Kelly, above, would leave at the end of the year — and Nick Ayers, the president’s first choice to replace him, declined the job.

Mr. Ayers, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said on Sunday that he, too, was leaving the administration.

That leaves the White House in another chaotic staffing scramble. According to one study, turnover among senior staff is at 62 percent, far higher than at the same point in the administrations of President Obama (24 percent) and George W. Bush (33 percent).
