Catch up: Mr. Trump said on Friday that he would nominate William Barr, who served as attorney general in the first Bush administration, to lead the Justice Department again. The president also confirmed that he would nominate Heather Nauert, a former “Fox & Friends” host, to replace Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations.

Prosecutors shift from Michael Cohen to Trump executives

After recommending a substantial prison term for President Trump’s former lawyer, federal prosecutors are turning their attention to other Trump Organization executives and to what they might have known about crimes committed in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign.

Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in August to breaking campaign finance laws and other crimes, is to be sentenced on Wednesday. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Trump of directing illegal payments to ward off a possible sex scandal that could have damaged his chances of winning the election.

Closer look: Prosecutors said Mr. Cohen offered only “selective cooperation” in the case, which is separate from the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.

From Opinion: The sentencing memos filed on Friday suggest that Mr. Trump and others might have been involved in lies told by Mr. Cohen and Paul Manafort, a New York University law professor writes.
