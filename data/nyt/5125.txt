Rick Jeanneret, the Sabres broadcaster, was taken out of the press box on a stretcher Saturday night during the third period of Buffalo’s game against the Anaheim Ducks.

The team did not provide an immediate update on his condition following its 3-0 victory, but one was expected. WGR radio, the Sabres’ flagship station, reported that Jeanneret was responsive before getting onto the stretcher.

Jeanneret, 76, has done play-by-play for Sabres radio and television broadcasts since 1971; he has the longest tenure with a single team in N.H.L. history. He was honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award in 2012.

In recent years, Jeanneret and the Sabres reached a deal to scale back his workload and have him call about half the team’s games. Jeanneret underwent treatment after receiving a diagnosis of with throat cancer in 2014.
