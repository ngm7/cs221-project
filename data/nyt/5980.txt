About a decade into the podcast boom, I’m continuously surprised there aren’t more shows about classical music. It’s an ideal medium: Little can compare with the experience of hearing someone talk about a piece, then listening to it with enlightened ears.

Yet few in the field have taken advantage of podcasting. Which is why the debut this month of “Aria Code,” by WQXR and the Metropolitan Opera, is both a major event and a gift. Eminently listenable and often illuminating, the 10-episode series is like a bonus feature for opera fans, and a welcoming entry point for newcomers.

Four episodes have been released so far, and each follows a simple format. The host — Rhiannon Giddens, the polymathic musician and MacArthur “genius” grant recipient — takes a deep dive into a famous aria with diverse guests who have included singers, scientists and even a sex worker-turned-writer. Then she signs off by playing the song in full. That’s it; the whole thing usually lasts no more than 30 minutes.
