Heading into last year’s holidays, marketers at HBO were eagerly experimenting with how to use technology like augmented reality and virtual reality to promote their shows. But then, celebrating with their families across the country, they watched as everyone from children to elderly aunts unwrapped smart speakers from Google and Amazon and started barking orders.

When they got back to work, the marketers had a new priority: Figure out how HBO, whose product lives on screens, could create a space for itself in the world of voice.

“We saw, partly because Amazon discounted the devices so deeply, that they exploded,” said Sabrina Caluori, HBO’s senior vice president of digital and social marketing. “Very quickly, we realized that we really needed to dig in.”

Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers do not run paid advertising, so brands have approached the devices in two ways. Some are trying to crack the code on search results and make sure that their products are mentioned first when users say they want to buy a specific item. Others are creating games that entertain people or tools that provide some sort of service (like directions for how to get a wine stain out of clothes) in order to build loyalty or name recognition.
