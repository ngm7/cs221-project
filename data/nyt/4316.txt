Whether you’ve grown weary of your dishes or are looking to furnish your cabinets for the first time, setting an Instagram-worthy dinner table doesn’t have to be stressful or expensive.

Michael Sullivan, kitchen writer at Wirecutter, has held multiple restaurant jobs, from dining-room manager to pantry chef. He’s researched and tested water and wine glasses, tableware, and linens to find practical and beautiful settings that add effortless elegance to any meal.

Upgrade your glassware

Choosing a complete set of water glasses is an affordable and easy way to add a unifying motif to an otherwise eclectic table. Restaurants the world over — from casual street cafes to Michelin-starred establishments — rely on $5-a-pop Duralex Picardie glasses because they’re as tough as they are pretty. Their tempered-glass construction allowed them to survive multiple drops onto a marble slab in our test kitchen, and they should last for many years of regular use in your home.
