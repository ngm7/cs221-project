It was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and Joseph Sciorra was ready to build his presepio in his Williamsburg apartment. A Styrofoam base was in place on a small table in the corner of the kitchen. There were plastic containers and tape and nails and dried bunches of herbs to serve as vegetation.

This year, his presepio — an elaborate Nativity and village scene traditionally built by Italians during Christmastime — would contain a pond, a stream and a waterfall for the first time. But just as he was starting to build, disaster struck. His pump broke.

These tiny pumps, crucial for the waterfall, are an integral part of dozens of homemade presepi in New York City. The presepio — which originated in the 13th century in Rome — is to Italians what the Christmas tree is to Germans and Santa is to Americans.

New Yorkers might be familiar with the presepio under the Christmas tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a classical Neapolitan Baroque crèche. But to see the authentic, paisan versions Italian immigrants brought with them, you need to venture to neighborhoods like Ozone Park in Queens or Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn.
