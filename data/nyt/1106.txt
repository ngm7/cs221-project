Sam Elliott: Many pundits wondered whether this beloved veteran could pull out an Oscar win for best supporting actor, but his “A Star is Born” performance wasn’t even nominated by the Globes. Expect this trophy to go to the “Green Book” actor Mahershala Ali: The Globes were the only major awards body to not give Ali the win for “Moonlight,” and they’ll seek to make it up to him.

“If Beale Street Could Talk”: Though this sensitive romance managed nominations for best drama, best screenplay, and best supporting actress for Regina King, the director Barry Jenkins missed, and Nicholas Britell’s intoxicating score for the film was shut out of the best score category.

“Burning” and “Cold War”: Two of the year’s most acclaimed foreign films, with titles on opposite ends of the temperature spectrum, were shut out of the foreign film category. Still, one sure thing made it in: Netflix’s big Oscar play, “Roma,” which the Globes deemed ineligible for the best drama category since that race is reserved for English-language films.

A24: The hip indie studio that gave us “Moonlight” and “Lady Bird” has taken a top feature prize at the Globes each of the last two years, but A24’s best hopes — the comedy “Eighth Grade” and the drama “First Reformed” — failed to crack their main categories. (At least the “Eighth Grade” star Elsie Fisher was nominated for best actress in a musical or comedy.)
