Several months ago, I was lingering over dessert at a restaurant where I am slightly acquainted with the chef, who came out of a quieting kitchen to join me. The conversation, as it often does in Washington, turned to the discernible changes in the dining scene since President Trump, who is known to dine almost exclusively at home, came to town.

Things were largely moving along just fine — new outposts for Laotian fare had opened up, along with charred steak joints, exciting taquerias and Chesapeake oyster houses — but he noted with regret that Washington chefs were no longer making the scene at the White House. No more cookouts on the South Lawn. No more helping in the staff’s mess, or taking trips around the world as culinary ambassadors on behalf of the State Department. Basta, pasta.

I wondered if his was a pervasive view. Finding out would marry two of my long-term reporting interests — politics and food — and I would probably learn about five new restaurants along the way. Appetites thrive in darkness!
