You can now freeze your child’s credit files for free — and it isn’t as difficult as even the most cynical among you might expect it to be.

Do you remember what it was like trying to maneuver through the credit bureaus’ systems after the Great Equifax Hack of 2017? Many people seeking credit freezes spent hours (or days!) fighting their way onto websites that were not built for moments of mass panic. Some of those folks had to pay fees to protect their own information, which was galling.

Thanks to a new federal law, free credit freezes are available to everyone from your infant to your great-grandmother. And on the first day that kiddie freezes (and here, kids are 15 and under) were mandated, I froze the files of my two daughters just to see how badly things would go.

To my surprise, the experience wasn’t bad at all. But I had some questions for the credit reporting companies, and I tried to anticipate the things that might confuse you, too.
