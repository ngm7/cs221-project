Donald and Patricia Oresman’s New York City home was designed to display and store their vast art collection, along with hundreds and hundreds of books. Their art collection was unique. Each work of art depicted the quiet solitude of reading. Photos and paintings were displayed throughout their home, and hidden in drawers and nooks.

Much of the Oresman’s lives were devoted to literature and art. Patricia Oresman was a social worker who studied Emily Dickinson. Donald Oresman was a lawyer and businessman who sat on the boards of the Library Company at Philadelphia, the Larchmont Library, the Morgan Library and the New Criterion.

“I think there is an intensity to reading that captures artists’ imaginations because it has a very private element to it,” Mr. Oresman explained at Poets House in 2004 at an exhibition of his and his wife’s collection.
