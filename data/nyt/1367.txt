“It’s a very high-end boutique building, so there’s a lot of personal care,” Mr. Stroming said.

Monterrey, Mexico’s third-largest city, is known as the industrial and economic center of the country’s northern region, as well as a hub for modern art and culture. The suburb of San Pedro Garza García, part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, offers a wealth of retail and restaurants, all a short walk from High Park. (The building itself includes two levels of retail spaces.) Barrio Antiguo, Monterrey’s historic district, and the city center, with its museums and parks, are about five miles east, while Monterrey International Airport is about 20 miles away.

Market Overview

With a population of about 1.2 million in the city and 4.5 million in the greater metropolitan area, Monterrey is one of Mexico’s largest and most active real estate markets, with some of its most expensive properties, agents said.

The state of Nuevo León, which is dominated by the city of Monterrey, saw more than 40,000 home sales between January and August of 2018 — a huge portion of Mexico’s approximately 145,000 sales nationwide during that period — according to an October market report published by Realty World Mexico, an agency with offices across the country.

Buyers gravitated toward older and more affordable units, and also toward rental properties rather than purchases, in part because of rising inflation, said Jorge Paredes, the chief executive of Realty World Mexico and the report’s author.

But Monterrey’s luxury properties also performed well. Between January and August of this year, sales of the highest priced properties in Nuevo León increased more than 6 percent over the same period in 2017, Mr. Paredes wrote, while luxury sales dropped almost 8 percent across Mexico.
