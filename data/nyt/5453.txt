Re “A Gutted I.R.S. Makes the Rich Richer” (editorial, Dec. 26):

I have been a tax lawyer since 1974, having started my career as an Internal Revenue Service lawyer before moving to private practice. It has been clear to those who work with the I.R.S. that both Republicans and Democrats through the years have been trying to cripple the agency through a “death by a thousand (budget) cuts.”

The purpose is obvious — to protect the rich from tax audits and collection. Both political parties have their friends and donors to protect, and those friends want a regressive flat tax. The I.R.S. cannot fairly enforce the current tax laws because it no longer has the resources to do so. As a result, “a flat tax would make the I.R.S.’s job easier,” goes the argument.

We will get a more regressive tax system along with a weaker I.R.S. as time goes by, leading to lower tax revenues, higher deficits and eventually cuts in social programs. This is a train that we have long seen coming down the track.
