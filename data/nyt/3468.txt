The Washington Wizards will officially reacquire the veteran forward Trevor Ariza on Monday, according to two people familiar with details of the trade.

But the Wizards had to construct a second trade to do so on Saturday after an initial three-way deal with the Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies collapsed Friday night in bizarre fashion, according to the two people, who were not authorized to discuss the details of the move publicly.

The deal that is now scheduled to be completed Monday, they said, is a two-team swap in which the struggling Suns (6-24) will ship Ariza to Washington for Austin Rivers and Kelly Oubre Jr.

A revised trade was needed after a chaotic attempt at deal making late Friday. While the Grizzlies were playing the Miami Heat at home, ESPN reported that Memphis had verbally agreed to join a three-way trade that would land Ariza with the Wizards, along with two future second-round picks; send Rivers to the Suns; and bring Oubre to the Grizzlies.
