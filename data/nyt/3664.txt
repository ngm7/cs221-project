Occasionally though, Paniccioli puts his subjects in dialogue with their surroundings: Fat Joe morosely standing atop a crushed car, or KRS-One posing sternly in front of the United Nations, or Nas, shot from below, arms wide open, in front of ecstatic clouds and a wide, blue, boundless sky.

While Paniccioli shot for some magazines, including Word Up!, he largely predated the era in which hip-hop was considered the stuff of serious artistic photographic attention. “Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop” (Clarkson Potter; $40), edited by Vikki Tobak, overlaps slightly with his era, but mostly picks up where he leaves off. This anthology shows hip-hop’s growth from the perspective of those charged with photographing it, mostly via magazine portraits and album covers.

The photos are of varying intensity, by photographers with varying degrees of intimacy with their subjects. Each image is paired with a brief anecdote from the photographer — Glen E. Friedman, Jamil GS, Barron Claiborne, Danny Clinch, and many more — about the shoot. Clinch’s photos for Big L’s debut album are particularly moving, the rapper and 20 of his friends crammed onto one stoop.

The images are accompanied by contact sheets, showing the just-before and the just-after, emphasizing that these are largely posed, not spontaneous, images. That’s the real value of “Contact High”: capturing hip-hop’s transition from improvisation to construction, from thrown-together fashion to stylists, from naturalism to poses. By the 1990s, when many of these photographs were taken, rap’s young stars were as meticulous about developing their visual images as much as their musical ones. (Though there is one great pseudo-candid here: XXL magazine’s 1998 A Great Day in Hip-Hop shoot in Harlem, by Gordon Parks, which gathered almost 200 of the genre’s leading lights for a giddy group shot.)
