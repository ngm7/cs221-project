Saoirse, you had been attached to this film since you were 18. If it had been made then, how different would your performance have been?

RONAN Very different. This sounds very actor-y and cheesy to say, but I did go through a bit of a transformation while I was making this. Mary was such a woman in power and so comfortable in that role, and it really helped me because I had “Lady Bird” just about to come out and things were shifting for me. There were a few tough choices I had to make professionally at that time — picking jobs and scheduling — and I owned them in a way I never would have done before. I think it was because I was playing a woman who made tough decisions, even when they weren’t going to make everyone happy. And that’s always torn me up, because I’m such a people-pleaser!

ROBBIE I’m the same. I say yes to everything half because I don’t want to let anyone down, and the other half because I have the biggest FOMO — I don’t want to miss out on anything. A few years ago, someone told me there’s a lot of power in saying no. The world keeps spinning if you don’t do something, and it’s kind of narcissistic to think that things won’t happen without your involvement. They absolutely will! Get over yourself.

RONAN The best piece of advice I got on this was from John Crowley, who directed “Brooklyn.” He said, “Don’t ever do something because you should do it, only do it because you want to do it.”

ROBBIE Hey, you said that while we were rehearsing, and I wrote it on my script! It’s the best thing I’ve ever heard, and the same goes for scenes, too. It’s not interesting to watch a character do something they should do. It’s interesting to watch them do something they want to do.
