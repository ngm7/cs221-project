The English Premier League, soccer’s leading domestic competition, has been forced to reopen its search for a new leader after announcing that Susanna Dinnage, who was picked to replace the longtime executive chairman Richard Scudamore, had a change of heart.

Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, would have instantly become one of the most powerful women in sports had she taken charge of the Premier League. In a short statement released late Sunday, the league gave no reason for Dinnage’s decision.

A nominations committee that had spent months looking for a successor to replace Scudamore, who is leaving at the end of the year after almost two decades, has reconvened and is already talking to candidates, the league said.

The sudden messiness surrounding the search is embarrassing for an organization that prides itself on getting its business done with little fuss. Scudamore and a small team of close advisers built a business that left major rivals in the shade by leveraging English soccer’s global popularity to build a brand known the world over and to generate television revenues — now worth more than 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) per season — that have far outstripped rival leagues.
