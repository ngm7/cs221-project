Your opening could be much stronger. You start by listing a bunch of characters the reader is somehow supposed to “know,” but their names are things like “Vixen and Blitzen” and “Dancer and Prancer.” Was the rhyming intentional? It was distracting. Remember that even though it’s fiction, it’s meant to be believable. Give these characters names like Fred, Luke, Greg, etc.

Then you introduce this “most famous reindeer of all” character. Your protagonist needs to have something at stake. Give this character a developed backstory and clear motivations. Instead of “Rudolph,” try calling him Dave Reindeer, a talented yet isolated writer who has been estranged from his family for the past 17 years.

“You would even say it glows” feels a little flat. Add a simile here, and make sure it’s consistent with Dave’s character. For example, “Glows like the end of every cigarette he swore would be his last.”

We have this harrowing flashback where we learn that Dave’s family laughed and called him names when he was a child. But all this name-calling happens off the page. To help the reader empathize with Dave, show us a few of these insults. It will allow us to really understand why Dave was so driven to move to a big city where he didn’t know anyone, rent a one-bedroom apartment and struggle through a series of setbacks until one day becoming a best-selling novelist.
