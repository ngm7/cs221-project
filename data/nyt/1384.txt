It’s telling that the sections of “The Great Pretender,” in which the male characters are supposedly at their most witty, charming and affectionate, are presented without audible dialogue. Some of the details about female characters that Silver and the screenwriter Jack Dunphy choose to foreground, like how one dots her i’s with little hearts, indicate that the filmmakers share with their male characters a strain of artsy-bro misogyny.

The movie is nevertheless striking and stimulating in some respects. Silver and the cinematographer Sean Price Williams shoot with dreamy diffused light that recalls certain scenes from Agnes Varda’s “Le Bonheur,” one of her most unusual pictures.

A well-known figure in New York’s cinephile community, Silver sometimes peoples his pictures with such folk — which obliges me to mention that I’m acquainted with several people who pop up onscreen in cameo roles. They all do fine work, as do the lead actors.
