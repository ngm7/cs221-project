WASHINGTON — Former President George Bush made his final journey to the nation’s capital on Monday, his coffin arriving at the Capitol as the rays of the setting sun washed over the plaza where family and friends stood solemnly during a 21-gun salute that began four days of commemoration of his life and death.

With all the pomp and pageantry of the first presidential state funeral in 12 years, Mr. Bush was welcomed back to the building where he served four years in Congress at the start of a political career that would take him to the heights of power. He will lie in state there until Wednesday’s funeral service at Washington National Cathedral.

President Trump visited the Capitol on Monday night to pay respects to his predecessor. The president and the first lady, Melania Trump, arrived in the Capitol Rotunda precisely at 8:30 p.m. and stood in silence before the coffin for two minutes. Mr. Trump clasped his hands before him and closed his eyes before delivering a crisp salute and departing.
