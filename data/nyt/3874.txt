For the second time in a month, the entertainment news website TMZ has obtained and released video apparently showing an N.F.L. player engaged in off-field violence, this time Washington Redskins safety Montae Nicholson, who seems to knock a man out cold during a late-night brawl in Virginia.

TMZ has not said how it obtained the video, but it is open about its willingness to pay for valuable videos and information. Last week the N.F.L. insisted that it would not pay for video evidence of player involvement in off-field incidents.

The newest video appears to show Nicholson, 23, throw one man to the ground and punch another man several times, including a hit that seems to render the man unconscious as he falls to the ground. TMZ published the video a day after Nicholson was accused of assault and arrested by sheriffs in Loudoun County, Virginia.

He was later released after posting a $2,500 bond.

According to the sheriff’s daily crime report, the incident happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday in Ashburn, Virginia. The Loudon County Sheriff’s Office said that Nicholson assaulted a man while a woman he was with struck another woman with a bottle. One of the victims said Nicholson and the woman pulled up in a car and honked the horn. An argument followed, then punches were thrown.
