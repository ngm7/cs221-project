The artist Livia Cetti’s studio, located in an early 20th-century farmhouse in Riverdale, N.Y., abounds with flowers: fiery orange marigolds, pillowy pink floribunda roses, candy-striped amaryllis and vivid fuchsia-flecked orchids. But these blooms are not fresh-cut greenhouse specimens — they’re intricate models sculpted by Cetti. Through her company, the Green Vase, the artist has become an in-demand creator of exquisite handmade paper flowers, which she crafts from carefully dyed, cut and rolled crepe and tissue paper; she has created geraniums for the design store John Derian in New York, cyclamen for the windows of Tiffany on Fifth Avenue and lavish Victorian-inspired bouquets for the ceramics and furniture store Astier de Villatte in Paris.

When we asked Cetti to take part in our regular video series Make T Something — for which a person must make something in under an hour using only a select few items, one wild-card object and a copy of The New York Times — it was no surprise that she chose to make a flower. But we could never have predicted her ingenious finishing touch. Watch the video to see the artist in action.
