Re “Yes, You Should Walk Your Cat,” by David Grimm (Op-Ed, Dec. 8):

I have walked my cat for years on a leash and can attest to the benefits. My cat can enjoy nature without being a predator or prey; get some exercise; socialize with friendly neighbors; enjoy some extra attention; and have a focal point in her day.

Sure, I get plenty of comments and bewildered looks, but even those can be fun. The best was a man who stared straight at us and said, “This is right out of ‘Seinfeld’!”

I tried walking our cat, a beautiful Persian- Maine Coon mongrel with the soul of a teamster, shortly after he came to us from his earlier life in a wide open suburb.

What I forgot was that a cat is a climbing animal that, when startled, will go up the nearest thing. On that day, the nearest thing was me.
