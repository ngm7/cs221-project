So what hath the buyer’s market wrought?

Price cuts are deepening, and agents expect more sellers to bend next year. Some developers are negotiating sweeteners, like offering to pay transfer taxes or common charges for a year or more. The rental market shows improvement, but uncertainty remains.

And the slowdown has convinced a growing number of developers to get creative with empty apartments — enlisting tech start-ups that flip unleased rental units for extended-stay travelers or turning unused living rooms into makeshift amenities. Others have doubled down on high-end marketing, while some have delayed listing properties altogether. Even film and TV crews are in on the act, as location scouts turn increasingly to empty luxury apartments for inspiration.

Primps and Cuts

Through the first three quarters of the year, 84 percent of ultraluxury listings — the priciest 10 percent in Manhattan — sold below the original asking price, up from 65 percent in 2015, when the market was riding high, according to StreetEasy. The median price cut remained unchanged at $500,000, which could suggest sellers need to cut deeper still, said Nancy Wu, an economic data analyst for the company.

“It feels worse when you’re out in the trenches,” said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which puts out a weekly report on contracts signed on properties seeking $4 million and up. That segment has taken an average of 441 days to go into contract so far in 2018, the longest stretch since at least 2013, when similar homes spent 172 days on the market. Through Dec. 2, $4 million-plus homes were reduced on average by 9 percent before a contract was signed, but Ms. Olshan believes that after sellers make additional concessions, the actual discount is closer to 15 or 20 percent.

She predicts that 2018 will finish with 6 to 10 percent fewer $4 million-plus contracts signed than last year, when 1,172 were signed, and roughly 20 percent fewer than during the peak year of 2013.
