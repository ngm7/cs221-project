In terms of bloodshed described in court, even the most violent Mafia cases have nothing on the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.

In the first four weeks of testimony, witnesses have recounted bone-chilling stories about people being stabbed in the face, getting gunned down on their doorsteps and nearly having their heads blown off. But while at least two dozen murders have already been discussed, many more dark tales — and much more grisly evidence — have gone unheard by jurors.

Judge Brian M. Cogan, who is presiding over the trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, has kept a tight leash on the gore, attempting to balance what is necessary to convey the stark realities of Latin American drug cartels and what is — literally — overkill. Judge Cogan seems to have taken the Goldilocks approach, looking for the spot between too much and not enough.

This week, however, his efforts were criticized by Mr. Guzmán’s lawyers as they began to cross-examine their client’s main cocaine supplier, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, an exceptionally violent man who, by his own admission, took part in at least 150 murders. When the lawyers asked Mr. Ramírez to describe some of these crimes, Judge Cogan halted the line of inquiry.
