Thousands of years have passed since the end of the world as we know it. That’s where the movie “Mortal Engines” (Dec. 14) picks up, amid a new civilization that has risen from the ashes of one wiped out in a catastrophic war. But now cities, rather than phones, have gone mobile.

Based on the steampunk-inflected novel by Philip Reeve, the film sets much of its action in London, which has been rebuilt as a tiered city that is quite literally on the move. Like a giant R.V., London rolls across the countryside, gobbling resources along its path. (It also devours other, smaller “traction cities.”)

To bring this version to life, the effects team at Weta Digital blended pieces of well-known landmarks with new buildings, constructing a kind of FrankenLondon . Here is a closer look at elements of it, with commentary from the director, Christian Rivers, and the visual effects supervisor, Ken McGaugh.
