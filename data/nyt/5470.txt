It can be hard for criticism to cohere when it’s perforated by ambivalence. A rave coasts along, buoyed by enthusiasm. A pan serves up the dramatic tension on a platter: The people trying to sell you a book (or movie or play) insist that it’s great, and here’s why it’s unremittingly awful. Mixed feelings are trickier, and more vulnerable. They’re like unstable elements waiting to be pulled into a wishy-washy middle ground.

Reading “The Earth Dies Streaming,” a collection of film writing by A. S. Hamrah, you realize it doesn’t have to be this way. As the resident movie critic of the journal n+1, Hamrah is committed to his ambivalence, conveying it with a mixture of precision and conviction that will remind you how much more there is to be gleaned from a review than whether a movie is “good” or “bad” (even if it’s a movie you happen to deem very good or very bad indeed).

When he first started reviewing films, Hamrah was bothered by how easily his sentences could get sucked into the maw of the entertainment industry, and so he resolved “to never include anything in my writing that could be extracted and used for publicity.” Nothing that might become a blurb, that is, if he could help it. He decided to make his negative opinions unusable too, resistant to algorithm-driven cultural curation.

“Write so that Rotten Tomatoes cannot apprehend your work,” he suggests, “which will allow its meaning to be deformed to the point where studios will not know what to do with it.” This is perverse. It is also delightful. A review that begins with “Whit Stillman’s movies are like porn films with the sex scenes cut out” will entice a curious human and confound an aggregation machine.
