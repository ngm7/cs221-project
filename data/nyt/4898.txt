After winning a $50,000 raise and becoming the highest-paid state legislators in the country, lawmakers in New York, one might think, would turn their focus to the people’s work.

Instead, the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, whined this week that the pay increase didn’t keep up with the increase in the cost of living since the Legislature’s last raise 20 years ago.

“I thought the sitting city comptroller would at least know how to calculate the rate of inflation,” Mr. Heastie huffed on Twitter, trolling New York City’s comptroller, Scott Stringer, a member of the special committee that determined the raise and, to address ethical concerns, limited stipends and outside income. In a testy back and forth with Mr. Stringer, Mr. Heastie also said the committee had overreached by daring to include those reforms along with the raise.

Rather than complaining about ethics reforms, Mr. Heastie would serve New Yorkers better if he put aside such pettiness and showed that the Assembly will be serious about enacting measures that can transform Albany from a punch line into a model of good government.
