BUFFALO — Outside KeyBank Center, home of the Buffalo Sabres, three bronze statues of the so-called French Connection line recall a time when Rick Martin, Gilbert Perreault and Rene Robert led the team to its first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in 1975.

Since then, the Sabres have been back to the finals only one other time, in 1999, and the specter of Brett Hull’s foot-in-the-crease, Stanley Cup-winning goal for the Dallas Stars that year still haunts this team and the city.

The Sabres have finished last in the N.H.L. standings three times since the 2013-14 season. They have not made the postseason since 2011.

Even the Bills, the Sabres’ N.F.L. neighbors who wrote the book on sports heartbreak with four straight Super Bowl losses in the 1990s, ended a 17-year playoff drought last season.
