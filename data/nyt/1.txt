That is what preview audiences are doing at “The Cher Show.”

“I stand on stage every night and I feel them wanting to say thank you to Bob. It’s a tidal wave,” Mr. Berresse said.

Mr. Moore, the director, said: “Everyone who knows who Bob is — and that’s a lot of our crowd — is overjoyed to see his designs, and those who don’t know him, know who he is now.”

Such attention can be daunting, even for a veteran like Mr. Mackie. Because he is shy by nature, content to stand one step outside the spotlight in which his leading ladies blaze, it has been hard for him to make peace with seeing a version of himself on a Broadway stage.

“All I said was, please don’t play me like a nelly, officious old queen who comes in with sketches under his arm,” he said. The designer’s dancing doppelgänger doesn’t do that.

“It’s important to me that I honor this person that I admire so much,” Mr. Berresse said. A navy blazer man in real life, Mr. Mackie did let himself have some fun with his onstage counterpart’s clothes. The fictional Bob, at one point, enters wearing a very groovy python jacket. “Bob said, ‘You know, I would never wear anything I’m making for you,’” Mr. Berresse said.

Regardless, when Mr. Mackie attends a performance at the Neil Simon these days, he is often greeted by adoring fans. “I get to watch people mob him and want to get their pictures taken with him and get his autograph,” Mr. Suarez said. “To be a small part of him having a big moment makes me beyond happy.”

The toughest critic of “The Cher Show” — Cher — is also overjoyed with this aspect of it. “There is simply no one like Bob Mackie,” she wrote in her email. “I love him. Always have. Always will.”
