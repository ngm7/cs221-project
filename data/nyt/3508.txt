“Vaping is reversing hard-fought declines in the number of adolescents who use nicotine,” said Richard Miech, the study’s lead author and a sociologist at the University of Michigan, in a statement. “These results suggest that vaping is leading youth into nicotine use and nicotine addiction, not away from it,”

The study, called Monitoring the Future, which is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and administered by University of Michigan researchers, asks nearly 45,000 students in eighth, 10th and 12th grade about their behavior and attitudes around alcohol and a variety of drugs. More than one in 10 eighth graders said they vaped nicotine in the past year, while 37.3 percent of 12th graders said they had done so, up from 27.8 percent in 2017.

The percentage of seniors who said they had vaped within the past 30 days — an indication of more frequent use — just about doubled, rising to 21 percent in 2018 from 11 percent in 2017.

Aside from vaping, the study had encouraging news about teenage use of most other drugs.

Tobacco cigarettes continued to remain at historic lows, with only 3.6 percent of high school seniors reporting that they smoke daily, compared to 22 percent two decades ago.

Marijuana levels remained stable, with 5.8 percent of seniors reporting daily use, a level that has stayed pretty much the same over the last 20 years. The study showed teenagers were beginning to move away from opioids and alcohol.
