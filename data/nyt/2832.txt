In its coming season the Joyce Theater will present dancers from Australia, Taiwan and Denmark, help celebrate Merce Cunningham’s centennial and host a new production by Maria Kochetkova.

Linda Shelton, the Joyce’s executive director, emphasized the importance of bringing international choreographers and dancers to the United States despite its difficulty. “I see a lot of my colleagues in the presenting world staying away from international work because the visa process has just become so unbearable and costly,” she said in an interview.

Australian Dance Theater, the Australian Ballet, Lucy Guerin Inc. and Dancenorth will appear in the Joyce’s Australia festival, April 29-May 12. Taiwan’s Cloud Gate 2 follows in June with a program of choreography by Cheng Tsung-lung. And in July, members of the Royal Danish Ballet will present work by August Bournonville, the 19th-century choreographer whose pieces form a cornerstone of the company’s repertory and technique.

But first the Joyce will participate in the worldwide celebration of Merce Cunningham’s legacy with five days of performances of his repertory work by Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet (April 17-21).
