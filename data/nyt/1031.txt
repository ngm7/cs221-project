The police shot a man during a chase and gun battle in the Bronx on Wednesday night that rattled the University Heights neighborhood and left the gunman, a female bystander and a 12-year-old girl injured.

At a news conference late Wednesday, Chief Terence A. Monahan of the New York Police Department estimated that the two police officers involved in the confrontation had fired 20 to 25 rounds. One chased the gunman on foot, the other in a police vehicle, Chief Monahan said. The gunman was struck twice — once in the neck and once in the foot — and was hospitalized but was expected to survive, the chief said.

The police said they had reviewed video evidence showing that the gunman, whose name was not immediately released, had performed a “drug rip-off” in the lobby of an apartment complex at 98 West 183rd Street. The man fired at people in the lobby, Chief Monahan said, and then ran out of the building.
