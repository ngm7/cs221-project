Eat2explore is another. It was created by Rowena Scherer, 50, who had an aha moment after taking a family cooking class while traveling in Thailand.

“I realized my kids couldn’t even dice or chop vegetables, and I knew it was because I do everything for them,” said Ms. Scherer, who used to work in finance. She suspected that if her children were more involved in the preparation of different dishes, they would be more likely to try them as well.

As a child in Malaysia, Ms. Scherer said, she and her family would cook lunch together each Sunday, letting her also practice what she learned in home economics class. “Because I had a familiarity in the kitchen and good knife skills, I had a lot of independence as a teenager. Cooking is a life skill, and we are not longer preparing our own kids in this way.”

Her company sells country-themed boxes (Brazil, Ethiopia, Lebanon). They cost about $20 to $25 and include nonperishable sauces and spices, three recipes that are local to the country, as well as maps and cards that explain why certain flavors and dishes are important to the particular culture.

The meals are meant to be cooked by children with help from a parent. “If you make something with your own hands, you are much more likely to try it and over time you will develop your palate,” Ms. Scherer said.

In Brooklyn, two longtime food writers and editors who have long preached the importance of passing cooking skills to children are now putting their money where their mouths are.
