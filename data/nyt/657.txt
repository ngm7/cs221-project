This week the art and fashion glitterati will breeze into South Florida for the annual ritual known as Miami Art Basel, filling their Rimowa suitcases with the latest resort wear from Gucci, Johanna Ortiz and Eres.

The fair has become a multi-million-dollar boon for the area, driving the creation of glitzy global outposts, including the Design District (where stores like Loewe, Fendi and Christian Dior operate) and Brickell City Centre (Orlebar Brown, Giuseppe Zanotti and Kiton).

And it has also spurred an evolution in the cityâ€™s homegrown aesthetic.

The Miami look has matured, moving beyond (but not abandoning) its night-life-centric platforms, minidresses and tight black tees, as well as its Versace-fied penchant for exuberant flair. The emergent style is casual-luxe and reflective of the multitextured local cultural blend. It is exemplified by Erika and Roma Cohen, who run Alchemist, a local retail outfit turned independent label.
