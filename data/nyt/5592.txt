For many Latinos, a new year is an almost magical chance for us to wipe the slate clean when the clock strikes midnight. As Gloria Estefan once sang, “Y vamos abriendo puertas, y vamos cerrando heridas” — we open new doors and close old wounds.

There are rituals that help usher in a better and brighter new year, like sweeping the house on New Year’s Eve to get rid of bad luck and make room for good luck. Brazilians wear white, which is said to bring good fortune. For Colombians, new, yellow underwear are bought to attract prosperity. Cousins of mine eat 12 grapes at midnight, one by one, and silently recite as many wishes, while my aunt burns incense to drive out any lingering bad juju.
