For about 30 years, I’ve been tacking pictures, memos, small talismans, odd cards and clippings to the cork wall behind my desk. Among the mementos are a recipe for my Aunt Bertha’s apple cake, which I’ve never made; many photographs of our son when he was half the height that he is today; pages from articles I wrote long ago; New Yorker cartoons; and some family snapshots from the days when we printed such things. The wall is seven feet long and messy — a haphazard collage more closely resembling an archaeological pileup than a purposeful archive. Most of the time, I walk into my room and pay no attention to the pinnings; in those moments, the accumulation is just wallpaper. But sometimes, when I’m working, I’ll swivel my chair idly, catch a glimpse of an image and stop for a minute. Pictures of my mother do that to me often. And then, a few weeks ago, my eyes fell on a button that’s seemingly been there forever. It says: Life is uncertain ... eat dessert first.

I’m sure the quote wasn’t meant to be parsed, but when work isn’t going smoothly, distraction is welcome, and so I spent more time than I should have staring at the button and considering its message. I couldn’t argue with life’s being uncertain, but in the end, my convictions about what a meal should be, particularly a meal for family and friends, wouldn’t allow me to champion dessert first.
