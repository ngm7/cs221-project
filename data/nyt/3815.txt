Re “Health Care Act Is Struck Down by Federal Judge” (front page, Dec. 15):

If the Supreme Court majority from several years ago holds, the district court decision holding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional will be overruled. And, if the midterms are any indication, the judge may have given Democrats a winning campaign issue in 2020.

That said, even after a long career studying health policy, I just don’t understand why elected Republicans insist on acting against the interests of their constituents and their states. Why do they want to deprive people of affordable health insurance?

Medical care can be the difference between life and death or between chronic disability and continued productivity. But it is expensive. So, we need insurance to help pay for it. Our elected officials should be making coverage more secure and more affordable, not less so. It’s good for us as individuals and our society.

American health care is the most market-oriented and most expensive in the world. There is much room for improvement. That is what our elected officials — even Republicans — should commit themselves to. And what we should demand of them.
