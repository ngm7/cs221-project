It is not a spoiler to reveal here that this movie ends in one of the ghost cities of China’s Inner Mongolia.

As the title of “Ghostbox Cowboy” indicates, the unpopulated metropolises built by China’s government have a metaphoric affinity with this unusual movie — a scary, dryly funny dissection of entrepreneurial absurdism bleeding into existential and metaphysical despair.

“Ghostbox Cowboy” is written and directed by John Maringouin, making his fiction feature debut, even though many of the actors here are billed as playing themselves; his 2006’s domestic documentary “Running Stumbled” insisted on a similar formal elasticity.
