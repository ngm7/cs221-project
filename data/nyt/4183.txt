The hardest part of a stroke is not the medical event, but what comes after. It’s a long, slow recovery of both the mind and the body.

In December 2017, my mother had a stroke. At the time, she was in Mumbai with my little brother. Her right arm, leg, eye — the whole right side was paralyzed. We didn’t know if she would walk and talk again. But she did, with lots of love, support and physiotherapy. And a little help from crossword puzzles.

It seemed to me that her brain also needed some exercise, so I decided to introduce her to crosswords. She has an M.A. in sociology and her native language is Hindi, but she can understand a bit of English. Crosswords are not as popular in Hindi-language newspapers and magazines, so I found some Hindi crosswords online and printed one for her to solve. As we sat together, I explained how Across and Down clues worked. Soon she was hooked. One by one, we plowed through each of the clues.

A stroke often comes with short-term memory loss. Sometimes Mom would be confused, considering an Across word, but looking for its clues in Down, or vice versa. Or she’d start considering a clue for a word that was already done.
