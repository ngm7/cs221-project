Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

This week, I talked with Scott Wiener, a state senator from San Francisco, about his second attempt at getting a sweeping, divisive housing bill through the Legislature.

But that’s not the only bill he’s resurrecting. For the third year in a row, Mr. Wiener is trying to put off closing time with legislation that would let cities decide whether to allow bars, clubs and restaurants to keep selling alcohol until 4 a.m.

“We’re at a disadvantage here,” he told me, adding that visitors from other states are “shocked when, at 1:30, the bartender announces last call.”

Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown disagreed.

While businesses and cities have supported the move, since it could boost revenue, Mr. Brown sided with law enforcement officials who were concerned about drunken driving and other problems.
