The maker of Kotex tampons has voluntarily recalled several lots of its product because of a defect that caused them to unravel upon removal, leaving pieces inside consumers’ bodies, the company said.

The company, Kimberly-Clark, said in a statement that the defect has caused an unknown number of consumers to seek medical attention to remove pieces left inside their bodies. There have also been a “small number” of reports of infections, vaginal irritation and injury, the statement said.

The recall was limited to specific lots of U by Kotex Sleek Tampons, regular absorbency, which were manufactured between Oct. 7, 2016, and Oct. 16, 2018, and distributed between Oct. 17, 2016, and Oct. 23, 2018, the company said.

Consumers can report problems to the Food and Drug Administration. Whether consumers could get a refund, the total number of tampons covered in the recall and the exact nature of the defect were not immediately clear. A company representative could not be reached on Sunday.
