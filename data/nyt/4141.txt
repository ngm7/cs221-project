MANCHESTER, England — Inside Old Trafford, 75,572 fans stood at attention. On the field, Manchester United’s players gathered in a huddle, fresh from victory against Swansea City, arms draped around each other’s shoulders.

In the center circle, Alex Ferguson shuffled from foot to foot. He was about to say goodbye to the club he had managed for 27 years. This had been his final home game, his final league title, his final triumph. He had “no script” for the speech he was about to give.

As Ferguson planned what he was going to say, Alan Keegan, United’s longstanding stadium announcer, had the microphone. He called Old Trafford to order. He listed Ferguson’s achievements, though everyone in attendance knew them by rote. He described the club the Scot had built: “rulers of English football, the most revered club in the land.”

“We have history at our mercy, and our destiny is firmly in our own hands,” Keegan said.

Finally, the rain pouring down, soaking him through, Ferguson spoke. He thanked the fans, the club, the staff. He informed the crowd that their “job is now to stand by your new manager.” He offered a final instruction to the players, too. “Don’t ever let yourselves down,” he said. “The expectation is always there.”
