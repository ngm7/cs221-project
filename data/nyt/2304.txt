He added, “What happened to Jazmine Headley and her son Damone should never have happened, should never happen to anybody.”

He said that he first learned of the episode on Sunday evening and then inquired about it to officials at the Police Department and the Human Resources Administration.

“I reached out to the commissioners involved for an update on what had happened and why,” Mr. de Blasio said. “They both told me they were getting facts immediately. Until I got their side of what happened, I could not speak to the public. Once I had it I did.”

He added, “What I say has to be definitive.”

By Tuesday morning, prosecutors had dropped the charges against Ms. Headley — which included resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration and trespassing. She was finally released from Rikers Island on Tuesday evening after a State Supreme Court judge in Brooklyn ruled that she would not be transferred to New Jersey to face an unrelated credit card fraud charge, for which she had an outstanding warrant.

Ms. Headley appeared in court in New Jersey on Wednesday. Brian Neary, her lawyer, said she was accepted into a pretrial intervention program that would require her to do 20 hours of community service and report periodically to the authorities in order to have the charges dismissed.
