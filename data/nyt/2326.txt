Silvery-white and durable, the metal is used in surgical instruments, dental alloys and in cellphones and other electronics. Jewelers like Jenny Windler in Berkeley, Calif., sometimes use it because it is hypoallergenic and “not too fussy to work with,” she said . Palladium was also less expensive than other precious metals like gold or platinum.

In the past few months, palladium men’s rings have been among the most popular search terms on her online store, Ms. Windler said . But she uses the metal in less than 10 percent of her products.

Recently, Ms. Windler was buying platinum online and noticed a price chart that listed palladium as more expensive.

“I thought, ‘that can’t be right; it must be some kind of typo,’” she said.

A price driven up by passenger cars

Increasing efforts to regulate tailpipe emissions in the 1970s paved the way for palladium’s gradual popularity.

The metal, along with platinum and rhodium, helps keep toxic exhaust in check by reacting with carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide to make them less harmful. For decades, palladium has been a major, but largely unseen, component of cars.

A shift away from diesel vehicles, whose catalytic converters rely more heavily on platinum, has intensified the demand for palladium, especially in Europe. Sales of gasoline-fueled cars had surged for several years until this year. T ighter emissions regulations have led automakers to use more palladium.

Demand for the metal for catalysts will reach a record high of 8.5 million ounces this year, according to the consulting firm Metals Focus.
