Re “A Peaceful Exit, but First, One Last ‘I Love You, Too’” (news article, Dec. 2):

The irony that President George H.W. Bush died peacefully at the age of 94 on the eve of World AIDS Day should not be overlooked. Peter Baker’s touching account of the president’s final days and passing, described by Mr. Bush’s pastor as a “very graceful, gentle death ,” belies the suffering and anguish endured by so many of those who died prematurely of AIDS during his administration.

Mr. Bush’s appalling indifference to the epidemic spurred one activist, Mark L. Fisher, to describe his impending death from AIDS in 1992 at age 39 as a “political assassination .” So while it is understandable to extol the life of Mr. Bush, we must also remember to honor the memory of those thousands of AIDS victims who died on his watch.

To the Editor:

With a lump in my throat reading the dozens of stories being shared about “41,” the amazing George Herbert Walker Bush, the one small thing that brought tears was learning that his longtime friend James A. Baker III was there till the end, holding his hand and rubbing his feet.

There were things I didn’t like about Mr. Baker’s politics through the years, but what a selfless and loving and beautiful thing to do for a friend.
