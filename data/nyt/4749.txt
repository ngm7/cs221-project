The cavalier expansively offers his hand in a descending arc through the air. As the ballerina places her hand in his, she steps onto point and extends one leg behind her.

Welcome to ballet. This grandiloquent action, an archetypal example of ballet classicism, is a crucial transaction within supported adagio, that singularly momentous idiom: With the man’s assistance, a female dancer blooms all the more fully.

What does it say to us? Logically, viewers should attend above all to that joining of hands. Here’s a formal ritual of courtship, in which the woman accepts the man, at least provisionally, as a suitor. Far more powerful, though, is how, now on point, she becomes a multidimensional work of ideal geometry, sculpturally firm and theatrically radiant. No longer entirely human, she’s now also — in line, shape and projection — transcendent.

Such images abound in the work of the Franco-Russian choreographer Marius Petipa (1818-1910): You can see them in the dances he made for “Don Quixote,” “La Bayadère,” “The Sleeping Beauty,” “Swan Lake” and “Raymonda.” They confront us with a problematic but beautiful central issue of ballet: its highly ambiguous sexism.
