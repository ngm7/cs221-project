Hello! Welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture.

Netflix almost never releases viewing data of any kind, so I find myself intrigued by any little crumbs of insight into how people use their site. Today they released a list of their 10 shows with “the highest average watch time per viewing session,” or to translate, the shows people have binged the most. Teen shows dominate (“13 Reasons Why,” “On the Block”), and I am kind of horrified to see that people not only watched “Insatiable,” but binge-watched it.
