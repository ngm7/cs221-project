In an attempt to secure a pay raise while sparing themselves the unseemliness of publicly voting for one, Albany lawmakers outsourced the job to a committee of four notable figures.

The committee, which must issue a report by Monday, has been delegated the authority to issue pay recommendations that would be binding unless rejected by the Legislature. By some accounts, that could mean a raise of nearly 90 percent. The thinking seemed to go that any decision by these well-respected men — the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer; the former city comptroller, William Thompson Jr.: the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli; and the former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall — would be beyond reproach. In terms of their personal reputations, that is certainly true.

But since it’s simply common sense that legislators should get no pay increase until they approve reforms to limit conflicts of interest — including a ban on outside income — it’s worth noting that the pay committee itself has conflicts, ones that could raise questions about its own independence .

Mr. McCall is the chairman of the State University of New York Board of Trustees, which depends on Albany lawmakers and the governor for state funding.
