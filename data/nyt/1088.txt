THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL on Amazon. The first season of this Amazon dramedy ended the way many stand-up sets do: with a “Thank you and good night!” Since then, it has become the first streaming series to win the best comedy Emmy. That accomplishment sets high expectations for Season 2, which continues the story of Midge (Rachel Brosnahan), a housewife-turned-comedian in late-1950s Manhattan. The first season charted Midge’s transformation as she dealt with the fallout from a split with her husband, Joel (Michael Zegen). Season 2 picks up where the first left off, and for a time brings Midge out of New York, to Paris and the borscht belt. “The season repeats many of the conflicts of the first,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. “There is a lot of movement here, but not necessarily a lot of progress.” Still, he noted, “Scene by scene, the new season is a stunner.”
