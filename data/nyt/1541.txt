Belisario Betancur, a Colombian president in the 1980s whose efforts to end a guerrilla war in his country were undermined by a spectacular rebel attack on the Palace of Justice in Bogotá that led to more than 100 deaths, died on Friday in a hospital in Bogotá. He was 95.

His death was announced by the hospital, Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogotá.

Mr. Betancur (pronounced bet-an-CUR) was an unusual figure in Colombian politics. He came from a working-class family in the provinces, rather than from the Bogotá elite. During the period of dictatorship in the 1950s, he was repeatedly jailed on political charges.

Mr. Betancur failed to win the presidency three times before succeeding in 1982. In office, he introduced programs that provided low-cost housing and education, a successful literacy campaign and other reforms. He ceaselessly promoted peace initiatives, both at home and abroad.

“His legacy in politics, in our history, in culture is an example for all future generations,” President Ivan Duque tweeted.
