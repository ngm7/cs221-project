On late Sunday night a scuffle broke out between a New York police officer and five homeless men at a subway station in Manhattan. The officer single-handedly fended off all five with just his feet and his baton.

The scene was captured on video by a bystander and shared on social media, where it was viewed hundreds of thousands of times. But the officer, Syed Ali, had no idea the video had gone viral.

Then, at 5 a.m. on Monday, a fellow officer called Officer Ali and asked him if he had seen himself online.

Officer Ali, who does not use social media, did not know he had even been filmed.

“Holy cow, what the hell is this?” he said he thought to himself after watching the video.
