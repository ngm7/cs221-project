Turning Point: A World Bank report concludes that more than 143 million people will become “climate migrants” escaping crop failure, water scarcity and sea-level rise.

When culture and recreation come together communities emerge.

When communities become societies a settlement is formed.

In those realities we inhabit our aspirations of togetherness.

Sustainable cities are like a forest: ever-growing and diverse. In a forest, each branch, each trunk, each tree is unique, blossoming in its own way. Yet everything is connected. Everything in the forest has its role in a cosmic symphony. The city is no different.

The city, too, is an organism, both stable and fluid, static and constantly transforming. Humans are a part of the city’s inner mechanism, just as our cells are a part of us. Streets act as veins, connecting us to a network of life similar to a bio-diverse forest.
