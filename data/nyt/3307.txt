What’s on TV

MISS UNIVERSE 7 p.m. on Fox. Despite his 2015 misstep, which led, briefly, to the crowning of the wrong Miss Universe, Steve Harvey steps back onstage as host of the competition. This year, nearly 100 women from around the world compete in Bangkok to claim the title. Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, last year’s Miss Universe, returns to crown her successor.

A GINGERBREAD ROMANCE 8 p.m. on Hallmark. It’s the peak of Christmas movie season, and the Hallmark machine has rolled out another festive flick. Tia Mowry-Hardrict portrays Taylor Scott, a successful architect whose boss asks her to create a life-size gingerbread house for a competition and blow their rival firm out of the water. Cue the entrance of Taylor’s knight in shining armor: the pastry chef Adam Dale (Duane Henry). Despite their differences, the two feel an intense connection, but now Taylor must make a decision: Will she take her promotion in Paris or stay behind and build a life with Adam?
