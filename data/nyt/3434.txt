We are in a month of celebrations, which means that extra resources are channeled into the kitchen. Those of us who don’t normally spend time discussing recipes, menus and table settings are busy making sure that they don’t fail the good-host test. Cooking aficionados are also upping their games, hoping to prove that theirs is the clearest broth, the tenderest turkey, the smoothest mash. Like it or not, these are the meals we all remember.

For professionals, particularly in the cake department, the effort is taken to a different level. I witnessed this in Paris a couple of years ago, when I was assigned to write a magazine piece about the state of French pâtisserie (yes, eating cakes was something I was actually paid to do, I am embarrassed to disclose).
