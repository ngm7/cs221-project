The actors might forget their lines. The crew might forget to turn on the lights. And the set might be on fire. But “The Play That Goes Wrong,” the Monty Python-esque murder mystery farce, will go on, by transferring to an Off Broadway production at the New World Stages after its Broadway production closes on Jan. 6, 2019, the creative team announced Thursday. Performances in the new space will begin on Feb. 11.

The show, a parody of British theater which counts J.J. Abrams as a producer, won a 2017 Tony for best scenic design. It opened on April 2, 2017, and in August 2018, the play announced it had recouped its $4 million investment, officially classifying it a Broadway hit. It was initially supposed to close on Aug. 26. But in an unusual move, the producers announced that the play would remain at the Lyceum Theater until Jan. 6, 2019, where it will end after 27 previews and 745 performances.

In the fall, the production started a national tour as well. It is at the Kennedy Center in Washington until Jan. 6.

Written by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer and Henry Shields, “The Play That Goes Wrong” originated in London with the British theater company the Mischief Theater. It won a 2015 Olivier Award for best new comedy and has now run for four years in the West End. The Broadway production was directed by Mark Bell, but the Off Broadway show will be helmed by Matt DiCarlo. According to a news release, casting will be announced at a later date.
