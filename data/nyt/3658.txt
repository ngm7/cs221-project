Good morning. I once had a job at a posh little deli attached to a restaurant in a charming part of town. I’d arrive before dawn and heat a huge vat of water on the stove, perfume it with peppercorns, then slide five or six chickens into it to poach. I’d make mayonnaise while the chicken simmered, toast pecans, slice celery and grapes. When the chickens were done, cooked to softness, moist and fragrant, I’d allow them to cool, then shred them into a wide, wide bowl. Mixed with my mayonnaise, a whisper of mustard, some lemon juice, a little yogurt, a pillow of tarragon, the nuts and the grapes, it became a salad of uncommon luxury, the filling for sandwiches I’d sell for lunch and the center of cold prepared meals I’d offer for dinner after that.

I learned the recipe at the elbow of my boss, the deli’s chef, and never wrote it down. For a long time I could cook it from memory, scaling back the proportions to feed four or five instead of 30 or more. There were times when all I wanted to do was make that chicken salad.

But it got less good over time. I overcooked the chicken, bungled the ratios of lemon to mayonnaise, substituted walnuts for the pecans, lost the grapes. I fell out of love. The salad seemed old-fashioned, country-clubby, like something you’d get in a little cup at the airport. I put it aside.

Julia Moskin got me back on track. Her recipe for chicken salad (above), which she brought to The Times in 2016, restored the dignity of chicken salad for me, employing a gentle poaching technique that guarantees perfection in the meat and a dressing that gives the salad a velvety texture against the crunch of nuts and celery. You can make it in one fell swoop, if you like, but I’ve taken to making the chicken on one evening, then letting it cool and refrigerating it overnight, so I can shred it the following night and dress it for dinner in under 30 minutes.
