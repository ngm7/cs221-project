South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics, and with that came more Asian athletes and fans. There were also 13 athletes from eight African nations, the largest representation of athletes from African nations in any Winter Games. At the same time, the United States Olympic Committee fielded its most diverse team at a Winter Games. Of the 243 athletes, at least 10 were African-American and 10 were Asian-American. The Americans included Nathan Chen, Vincent Zhou, Mirai Nagasu, Chloe Kim, Erin Jackson and Jordan Greenway.

Other landmark moments: Naomi Osaka captured the U.S. Open title, becoming the first Japanese-born tennis player to win a Grand Slam championship. Ms. Osaka, 20, who grew up in the United States, has a Haitian father and a Japanese mother, and she is helping to challenge Japanâ€™s longstanding sense of racial purity and cultural identity.

Alex Cora, a native of Puerto Rico, coached the Boston Red Sox to the most wins in its 118-year history and a World Series championship. Dave Roberts, who has an African-American father and a Japanese mother, led the Dodgers to their second consecutive National League pennant. It was the first time that the World Series featured two teams managed by people of color.
