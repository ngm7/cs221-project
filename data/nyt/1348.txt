Les Moonves, the former chief executive of CBS, did what he could to obstruct the workplace investigation of the egregious sexual assault allegations against him, destroying evidence and misleading the lawyers who interviewed him. Despite his efforts, The Times reported, lawyers investigating Mr. Moonves found enough evidence to justify docking him a $120 million severance payment.

Most workplace investigations proceed with far less drama and without the knowledge of the media and the public. They typically begin after an employee reports to a company hotline, human resources or a company official that she or he has been harassed, assaulted or suffered some other inequity at work. The accuser’s company finances these inquiries, either assigning H.R. or hiring lawyers or other professionals to report on whatever they find. Thanks to the #MeToo movement, membership in the Association of Workplace Investigators, whose members conduct many of these inquiries, soared 25 percent over the past year to 998.

I attended the group’s annual conference this fall, and I was dismayed to hear the obstacles its members face, even when investigating executives much less famous or powerful than Mr. Moonves. I’ve been writing about gender discrimination for more than two decades and know that even the most principled investigators can come under intense pressure from companies who sometimes use their work to put the accuser on trial.

Part of the problem is the nature of these investigations. They are not civil or criminal proceedings subject to public scrutiny; and even when the investigator concludes that harassment took place, there’s no guarantee the company will do the right thing and protect the victim.
