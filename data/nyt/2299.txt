With apologies to the listicle gods, not to mention the headline gods, I don’t mean this to be a definitive list of the best things I ate this year. I change my mind too often and besides, such a list would overlap considerably with my ranking of the best new restaurants reviewed in 2018. It seems more fair, or at least more interesting, to spread the love around. So the list that follows, in alphabetical order, is drawn exclusively from places that didn’t make my top 10 but still do at least one thing very, very well.

Arista di cinghiale at Ristoro del Cinghiale

In Tuscany, wild boar is typically stewed to smithereens. Boar ragù is on the menu at Ristoro del Cinghiale, too, but the place also offers a rare opportunity to eat roasted boar. Eight ribs and their attendant loin are smeared with salt and pepper; their flavor isn’t like any other meat’s, but you won’t be far off if you imagine prime rib crossed with heritage pork chops ($85).
