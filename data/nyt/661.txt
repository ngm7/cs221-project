I was doing some research in the Library of Congress recently when I came across a fascinating article in the October 1944 issue of Fortune magazine. The article was written by William B. Benton, the co-founder of a major advertising agency. And by today’s standards, the article seemed almost socialistic — with Benton calling for a corporate America that paid good wages and accepted the need for labor unions and regulation.

But Benton was no radical in 1944. He was mainstream. Many other executives shared the same ideas. In the decades after World War II, most corporations followed those ideas. Chief executives didn’t try to earn every last dollar — and the incomes of their workers rose at a healthy rate.

My column today starts by telling the story of Benton’s article and the postwar American economy. The column ends by talking about a new bill from Senator Elizabeth Warren that’s intended to change how today’s more selfish version of corporate America works. I think her proposal is the most intriguing idea yet to emerge from the likely 2020 presidential candidates.
