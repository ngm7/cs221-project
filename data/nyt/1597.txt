“Championships,” Meek Mill’s first full-length statement following his release from jail earlier this year, didn’t fully capture what makes him so invigorating as a rapper. He’s an orator, and anything that prevents him from talk-rapping — namely, the dictates of song construction, especially when it comes to working within a melodic framework — is a distraction. So it’s appropriate that the most vital Meek Mill moment of this cycle comes on this freestyle, part of Funkmaster Flex’s ongoing series. He begins with a stroke of comity, speaking about reconciling with Drake, and then exuberantly raps over “Back to Back,” the song Drake used to dismantle him so effectively three years ago: “My old opps, they super mad, we left them pouring Henny up/‘Cause they homies got whacked, we bought Maybachs/Came through they strip, no tint, laid back.” But it’s later in the 10-minute performance that Meek Mill’s talents truly shine through. He’s become something of a cautionary tale, and he wants to warn others. For about five minutes, much of it aimed directly to the camera, he raps about the futility of the drug game, about the hopelessness that leads to poor decisions. “They tried to bury us, ain’t know that we was seeds/We had to trap, ain’t get no toys on Christmas Eve/Play that corner made you rich, what we believed,” he raps, with understanding and exhaustion. And then he goes on, telling people that there’s another way. JON CARAMANICA
