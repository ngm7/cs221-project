OAKLAND, Calif. — It did not seem confrontational, and he did not sound upset. But Kyle Kuzma wanted to make his feelings known.

“I mean, it’s not like we’re panicking because he’s gone,” Kuzma, the second-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers, said late Tuesday night. “We’re pros, too. We’re great players — or on our way to trying to be great players. So it’s all about that next-up mentality and having a will to win.”

Kuzma was speaking with reporters in the visiting locker room at Oracle Arena not long after the Lakers had demolished the Golden State Warriors, 127-101, on Christmas Day, and the “he” to whom Kuzma was referring was LeBron James, the leader of the Lakers and the most dominant player of his generation.

James had strained his left groin in the third quarter, leaving his teammates to fend for themselves against the N.B.A.’s reigning champions. The training wheels were off, and the Lakers’ lesser lights seized the opportunity.
