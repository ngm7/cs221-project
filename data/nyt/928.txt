Greetings, friends. I’m Brian X. Chen, a tech columnist, meaning my job is to obsess over tech news so you don’t have to. So here’s the CliffsNotes version of the week in tech.

I remember a time when tech companies were desperate to be in the news. Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company’s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading.

So I bet Facebook wishes it could be out of the news cycle, even briefly. This week, a British parliamentary committee released confidential Facebook emails and documents as part of its investigation into online misinformation. And they did not make Mark Zuckerberg’s social networking empire look good.
