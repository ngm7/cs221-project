These images are mainly avatars, vaguely humanoid with insectlike touches, always synthetic-looking. Several of the digital figures have many more limbs than Ms. Vishneva does, sort of like the goddess Kali, so that when they match the motion of her arms, the effect is multiplied.

That’s the drift of the projections (visual art by Tobias Gremmler, avatar technology by the production company Fuse): effect after effect, the same operations recurring. The images swirl, ripple, atomize and refract kaleidoscopically. Occasionally, they even acquire an impressive illusion of texture and mass. But then it’s time for the next effect in an ultimately tedious succession.

According to the synopsis in the written program, the avatars are demons in the first act (Fear, Greed) and temptations in the second (including her own fury). The princess is supposed to be battling these interior forces in a quest to discover her true self. That sounds a bit like one of Martha Graham’s psychological dramas, but here there is no psychological insight and almost no drama.

The best that can be said about Thijs de Vlieger’s score (which alternates clichés of Hans Zimmer’s movie style with clichés of electronic dance music) and Edward Clug’s choreography is that they serve the technology. Mr. Clug makes Ms. Vishneva swirl so that her avatars might, and puts her on the floor often so she’s out of the way. This impression of secondary service is reinforced in the second act, when digital technology is temporarily superseded by Bart Hess’s chic costumes, and Ms. Vishneva moves so that her feathers will.
