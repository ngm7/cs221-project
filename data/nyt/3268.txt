For a credible Oscar campaign, it helps to have three things: money, talent and an ability to connect with people.

Netflix has plenty of the first, and it’s counting on Dolly Parton to serve up the other two. That’s why in October, before Netflix had even released a trailer for its new beauty-pageant comedy, “Dumplin’,” the streaming service rented out the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills for Parton to perform “Girl in the Movies,” a song she penned for the film.

This year’s Oscar race for best original song is awfully crowded, and most presume that “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” is the unshakable front-runner. Still, Netflix is hoping to press its way into new categories this year, and who better than a two-time nominee like Parton to lead the charge? After all, few people possess star power like the 72-year-old country singer, who aims to dazzle you with her look and disarm you with her voice.

Though she is movingly plain-spoken on her records, Parton’s star persona is anything but plain. On the day I met her at the Four Seasons, she was swaddled in jewelry, zippers and sequins, with blond hair as high as her heels and a physical presence so outsized that you could probably sketch her silhouette from memory. This is all to say that though your Carpetbagger rarely gets star-struck, Parton was serving enough glitz and glamour that even a monk might have asked for her autograph.
