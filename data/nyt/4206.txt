Verónica Sanchis Bencomo never knew what she would encounter when she worked helping to archive photo books and other items at the library of the International Center of Photography . The experience was an education in itself for Ms. Sanchis Bencomo, a Venezuelan photographer, but not in the way you might imagine.

“Where are the contemporary Latin American women photographers?” she wondered. “You had the great ones, like Graciela Iturbide, but there wasn’t a lot about contemporary ones. Where were my peers? In a region so big, how can there not be any?”

She has been answering that question almost four years now, after she founded Foto Féminas, a digital platform and library that features a different photographer working in Latin America and the Caribbean each month. With her eye focused on their images and not on their credentials or contacts, Ms. Sanchis Bencomo has convened a virtual community of experienced and emerging photographers alike whose styles range from documentary and photojournalism to fine art and conceptual photography.
