Kevin writes: I was born Nov. 22, 1990, but in 2033 I would like to turn 44 instead of 43. I already tell everyone that I’m 29. But whenever my age comes up, my roommate tells people that I’m lying. Please tell her to accept my age.

As you may know, a Dutch court recently denied Emile Ratelband’s request to change his age. While biologically 69, he claimed he identified as 49 — mostly to up his Tinder game and to troll transgender people. While your motives are benign and endearingly dopey, this court stands with precedent. Until we’re all brain patterns on computers, there are still forces that do not bend to our wants, including senescence and death. (You’ll talk like this, too, when you hit 40.) So lie about your age if you like. But don’t complain when your roommate laughs at you. Time certainly does.
