Turning Points, a magazine that explores what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead, asked five artists to select one of their own artworks and describe how it symbolized or reflected 2018.

“Heavy Rag” (2018)

2018: The year that the words “rape,” “assault” and “harass” became inescapable, appearing seemingly everywhere online and in news media across the United States. The year some heads rolled, and lives were ruined, and the year many tales were forgotten too quickly or discredited in too brutal a manor. The year of too much jumping on the bandwagon. The year of attempted payback, misguided payback and zero payback. The year of not enough follow-through and pitiful justice. The year women were taught that little has changed and they’re still not safe. The year the words “F.B.I. investigation” elicited instant eye rolls and a crushing sense of déjà vu.

The year I became even more proud of so many of us — and remained ever unsurprised by the actions of so many more.

The year I learned some new tools, and was reminded of some old, forgotten ones. The year of triggers, and wounds unwound, and Nia Wilson, and Brett Kavanagh, and nausea.
