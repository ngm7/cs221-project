Age: 40

Occupation: professional rock climber; star of the documentary “The Dawn Wall”; author of “The Push.”

Location: Estes Park, Colo.

His favorite room: His garage, which he converted into a climbing gym and office. The big open room with a lofted work space is a big step up from Mr. Caldwell’s first practice wall at his childhood house, where he and his father glued rocks and fashioned a rudimentary arch from plywood. “This one,” he said, “is pretty awesome.”

There’s a Weezer song where the lyrics go, “In the garage, I feel safe.” How do you feel in your garage?

It’s totally like my Zen place. I put on music. I train. I get to recenter myself in there. My office is in there, too, so it’s my creative space.
