And then, there are the dogs.

The T.S.A. is using more dogs trained to detect explosives. The dogs speed the security process because passengers have already been vetted for explosives by the time they reach the scanners. “They’re a very important layer of security,” an agency spokeswoman, Lisa Farbstein, said.

Of course, bad weather could throw a wrench into all the plans. But airlines also have an answer for that — apps that they say will allow travelers to reschedule their flights more quickly than standing in line at the ticket counter.

The result should be smoother travel.

“The industry is not ignoring the challenge of this,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “What I’m encouraged by is that steps are being taken, these new initiatives are being implemented and anything that can help move people through the screening faster is going to benefit everybody.”

Multiple factors are responsible for the surge in passenger traffic, a 5.2 percent rise over the comparable period last season, industry analysts say. A robust economy with low unemployment and rising wages has given Americans more money and more confidence about spending that money.

“We’re basically experiencing the impact of a strong economy,” said Dan McKone, senior partner and head of the travel and transportation practice at L.E.K. Consulting. “While there’s a lot of mixed indicators impacting the markets, the overall economy remains strong and air passenger growth tends to be most highly correlated with G.D.P.,” he said.
