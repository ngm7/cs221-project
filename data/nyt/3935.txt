The mother of a child on life support in California was granted a visa waiver to enter the United States after her application was stalled because she is from Yemen, one of the countries included in President Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.

The mother’s plea to see her dying child received widespread news coverage in recent days, as the boy’s father begged the federal government to allow his wife to enter the country.

The waiver was approved on Tuesday morning, and the mother, Shaima Swileh, 21, will land in San Francisco on Wednesday evening and see her son for the first time in months.

The boy, Abdullah, 2, has a degenerative brain condition and has been hospitalized at the U.C.S.F. Benioff Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, Calif., since October.
