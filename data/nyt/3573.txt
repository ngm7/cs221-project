BUDAPEST — Inside the Hungarian state broadcaster on Monday afternoon, an opposition lawmaker was lying on the floor, surrounded by security guards. Outside the building, a fellow member of Parliament was trying to burst through police lines to reach him.

Both filmed themselves on their phones to broadcast the encounters on Facebook.

But on the main state television channel, the talk was all about pigeons.

“Pigeon meat,” said the narrator of a program extolling the virtues of pigeon farming, “is highly sought-after abroad.”

Under Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, the country has long been a place of parallel realities.
