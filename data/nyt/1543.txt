Mr. Vos, a brash leader known for keeping his caucus in line and widely seen as a chief architect of the bills passed this week, helped Mr. Walker turn Wisconsin into a stronghold of conservative policy in the last decade. Together, they enacted right-to-work and voter identification laws and a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. Mr. Vos had no intention of letting Mr. Evers reverse those policies.

Mr. Vos, whose party retained its legislative majorities, said he was open to compromising with Mr. Evers on some issues, “but it doesn’t mean that I’m just going to roll over and let him do a bunch of things that I ultimately disagree with.”

To Mr. Vos, the legislation was a happy marriage of political opportunism and his longtime skepticism of executive power.

He said limiting executive power had long been a goal of his, even under Mr. Walker. This spring, months before Democrats even nominated Mr. Evers, Mr. Vos said he had met with the governor and Mr. Fitzgerald to discuss ideas to rein in executive power. Much of what was passed this week, Mr. Vos said, came in that spirit.

“If you take the names off it and do it before the election, which of these proposals would a state legislator have not wanted to have a voice in?” Mr. Vos said. “I think the problem is the decisions were made at a time when Democrats in Wisconsin feel like their agenda was validated.”

The bills would prevent Mr. Evers from withdrawing from a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, block him from opting out of federal waivers and limit his administration’s rule-making authority. The bills also limit early voting to two weeks and give lawmakers the ability to hire outside lawyers and intervene in certain lawsuits. And the legislation targets the authority of the incoming Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, who would no longer be able to hire a solicitor general.
