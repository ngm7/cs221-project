The season of the nap is upon us. It’s cold. It’s dark. It’s going to be cold and dark for the foreseeable future. Anyone reasonable knows in his or her bones that the proper course of action over any given afternoon for the next several months is to take a nap. And so late stage capitalism has, naturally, found a way to pose the question: What would you pay for one?

At the Dreamery, an outfit opened by the mattress company Casper in Manhattan, naps are for sale. To be more precise, a 45-minute session in a darkened nook with peace and quiet is for sale for $25.

To be clear, this institution is no pod hotel. It’s no Japanese slab in a train station for professionals with too many meetings and no real desire to return home. If you need a room for a transaction of a temporary and illicit nature, it is definitely not your place. This is a nap joint; it sells the idea of the nap as much as the nap itself. From the street, you pass through a blue tunnel, flecked with starry lights, to a room that looks like the bedroom of a wealthy child whose parents met at a Decemberists concert. Everyone speaks in hushed tones.

Everything you might need to prepare for your nap is available: various lotions and balms, free toothbrushes, pajamas. “You miss a hundred percent of the naps you don’t take,” reads a little message on the mirror of the changing room. From there, a steward guides you into a quiet space filled with the hutches. You lie down inside, behind heavy curtains. When you’re ready, you turn off the light. Forty-five minutes later the light goes on again.
