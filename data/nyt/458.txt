All 463 larvae were raised in this room, whose climate was meant to constantly resemble a humid summer’s day at the water’s edge. A fan blew constantly across a humidifier, creating a fog-machine-like effect that kept the room at 60 to 80 percent humidity — enough to stop the sand from drying out, but not so much that the walls would mold.

It takes two to three years for an egg to mature into an adult Puritan tiger beetle capable of reproduction. In the lab, scientists can speed up that process and keep adults alive longer.

In nature, each female insect will reproduce herself — leaving on average one mature offspring behind, said Joe Elkinton, a professor of environmental conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who has collaborated with Dr. Gwiazdowski and helped with the release. But in captivity, insects can multiply themselves 100-fold in one generation, suggesting how many are lost to predators, starvation and other challenges. It also means that reared properly in a lab, it’s feasible to mature enough larvae to make a difference at the population level, Dr. Elkinton said.

Males are usually a little bit smaller than females. Researchers put a red dot on the males so they could be easily spotted and grabbed. From midsummer until the larvae collection was complete, the males were moved every day into a tub with a different female to promote breeding. Some females laid no eggs at all; one laid 126.

“When you put life in a box, it gets very complicated very fast,” Dr. Gwiazdowski noted.

Releasing the 463 larvae on the river banks was “like kicking the kids out at 18,” Dr. Saucier joked.

Dr. Gwiazdowski remained optimistic: “It’s easy to say goodbye. I’m really happy for them .”
