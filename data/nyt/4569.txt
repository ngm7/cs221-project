About 10 years ago, the chef Mashama Bailey asked her maternal grandmother, Geneva West , of Forsyth, Ga., to serve black-eyed peas with ham hocks and collard greens on New Year’s Eve. Ms. Bailey was returning to New York City, where she lived, and wanted to have that symbolic meal before she left that day.

A lilt in her grandmother’s voice suggested her reluctance to serve the dish before New Year’s Day. But Ms. West ultimately agreed.

“I felt loved when she decided to make that dish early for me,” Ms. Bailey said. “She had a special way of making all her grands and great-grands feel loved by her.”

Ms. West is gone, and Ms. Bailey, now the chef at the Grey, in Savannah, Ga., makes the black-eyed peas for New Year’s Day, hosting a feast at the restaurant that is rooted in tradition but also shows her own touch.
