CAT POWER at Brooklyn Steel (Dec. 18, 8:30 p.m.). This singer-songwriter, born Chan Marshall, recently released “Wanderer,” her 10th studio album and her first in six years. It’s stripped-down and reflective, and was produced entirely by Marshall herself. It’s also her first album since becoming a mother — the cover, fittingly, features Marshall, her son and her guitar. “There are two things I know for certain and that is my words — my songs — and my son,” she told Stereogum of the album art. “I am a reflection of those two things.”

OLD 97’S at Irving Plaza (Dec. 14, 7 p.m.). The members of this alt-country quartet are staging a holiday-themed tour to celebrate their first Christmas album, “Love the Holidays.” Most of the songs have the same winking, self-deprecating tone as much of their jaunty, rock-tinged catalog: “Rudolph Was Blue” is a lonely postscript on the classic holiday favorite, for example, and “Here It Is Christmastime” is a tribute to having someone to enjoy the holidays with, and also to help “do the dishes.” The band’s lead singer, Rhett Miller, will open the show with a solo set.

VIBRAS NYC at Baby’s All Right (Dec. 16, midnight). This semiregular party is the brainchild of its host and resident D.J. Bembona, who specializes in music of the Latinx diaspora. For this Brooklyn native of Puerto Rican and Panamanian descent, the diaspora includes everything from salsa and bachata to the music of the indigenous peoples of South and Central America to the newest strains of reggaeton and Latin trap. The event’s featured performers, the reggaeton and hip-hop duo Los Rakas, have collaborated with Blondie and Major Lazer, and earned a Grammy nomination in 2016 for their self-titled album, which is still a rarity for artists making urban Latin music.
