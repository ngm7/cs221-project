Blood and money have dominated the first month of testimony at the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo. The topics intertwined last week as two Colombian men who supplied Mr. Guzmán with hundreds of tons of cocaine testified over the course of three days.

The first man, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, Mr. Guzmán’s main Colombian connection, told the jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that he had taken part in at least 150 murders in the years he ran the North Valley drug cartel, both at home in Colombia and elsewhere in South America.

Mr. Ramírez, who wore a winter parka and a pair of gloves inside the court, testified about how the blood bath started in the early 1990s, when he ordered the deaths of several workers connected to his New York City drug distribution operation. It continued unabated until 2007, when Mr. Ramírez was arrested at a luxury condo in Brazil.

The victims were legion — prosecutors, thieves, former allies, Colombian military officers and a loose-lipped lawyer who once got drunk and talked about his business — but the full scope and details of the killing spree were never aired in court. Judge Brian M. Cogan told the defense that it did not need to thoroughly describe each of the murders Mr. Ramírez took part in to point out he was a violent man.
