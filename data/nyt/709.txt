To the Editor:

Last week I was being of no help to my son and his science homework when my mom called to tell me about Michelle Goldberg’s Nov. 27 column, “Maybe They’re Just Bad People.”

Ms. Goldberg mulls over my political memoir, “Life of the Party: A Political Press Tart Bares All .” The book is an accounting of the 15 years I spent in the trenches of the white-male-dominated industry of Republican politics, ultimately ascending to the role of spokeswoman for the former director of the Christian Coalition, Ralph Reed. Given that I’m Jewish, pro-choice and pro-gay rights, my story is unconventional. That’s why I told it.

A memoir isn’t an act of narcissism. It’s a documentary, a snapshot in time in which the contract with the reader is to tell the truth. I exposed the good, the bad and the ugly — and a couple of, um, activities no one wants to talk to one’s mom about. I pointed the spotlight into the darkest corners of a world very few have seen.

It’s impossible for a memoirist to discover who she is when she’s in the middle of her own story. Only now, 24 years later, do I understand the complicated relationships that I had with politics. And I’m very cool with that.
