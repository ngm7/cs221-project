I’m James Wan, the director of “Aquaman.” What we have here is Arthur, plate by Jason Momoa, goes back to confront his half brother, played by Patrick Wilson. And that’s the only way to stop Patrick’s character, King Orm, from trying to bring his war to the surface. And so what we have here is a classic sort of combat of the kings, a duel. A sword fight, if you will, but with tridents. In a Colosseum that is built into the cone of a volcano. It’s something that we haven’t quite seen before, and that was really my goal. And these guys, being Atlanteans, they have the ability to swim and move really fast. Part of the reason why I set this inside a volcano is because I want it to sort of get the interesting color palette of the warmth from the underneath, the characters, and then — but the cool light from above. And so what that does is it allows me to always let the audience know where they are when they are actually watching the fight sequence. Because the characters are spinning around, and camera’s twisting all over the place, you know, defying gravity. And so, it’s kind of hard to know where you are. And having the strong color palette just let the audience have a sense of this sort of geographic space. The way we went about designing the fight and the look of a fight underwater was I worked closely with my stunt team — amazing group of stunt choreographers and stunt performers. And we laid the fight flat on the floor to begin with because, you know, we’re surface dwellers, and that’s how we know how to do it. We do it on the ground, coming up with cool moves, cool attack moves, cool dodge moves, and jumps, and flips, and stuff like that. And then once we have a look that I’m happy with, now, we put the actors or the stunt performers either on wires or on these rigs that helped to give the impression and illusion of floating underwater.
