Google’s new campus selection of Hudson Square, once an industrial district just south of the West Village, strengthens its grip on Manhattan’s West Side, likely accelerating the neighborhood’s changes. That would mirror how Google transformed Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, where it has had an office since 2006. The company bought Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion earlier this year and an adjacent building in 2010, and it leases other space in the area, about a 20-minute walk from its new offices.

The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John’s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.

“New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent,” Ruth Porat, Google’s chief financial officer, said in a statement on Monday. “That’s what brought Google to the city in 2000, and that’s what keeps us here.”

New York’s transformation into a tech center began after the 2008 financial crisis, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg focused on the industry as an engine of future growth. His administration sought to upgrade the tech skills of the local labor force, a campaign that led Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, to open an applied science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island. Tech initiatives — new courses, buildings and research institutes — are also underway at Columbia University, New York University and the City University of New York.

Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.
