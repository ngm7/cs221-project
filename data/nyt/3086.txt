“G.E. is a 19th- and 20th-century industrial company with no real experience in modern software,” said Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of C3, a Silicon Valley start-up that competes with GE Digital.

Unlike G.E., C3 followed the typical high-tech model for a software company, beginning with small team and steadily improving its product. The company, founded in 2009, has more than $100 million in yearly revenue and is growing at 80 percent annually. C3’s last venture funding round values the company at $1.4 billion, Mr. Siebel said.

In the last year, GE Digital has cut its spending and more tightly focused its business on software for specific industries. The spinoff move is a further move in that direction.

The step is also a measured vote of confidence in the software business. Some analysts and competitors had expected Mr. Culp to shut the unit down or sell it off. Once GE Digital is spun off early next year, the business will have its own brand, board of directors and equity structure. It will be run independently, while still owned by G.E.

But G.E. said it would sell a majority stake in ServiceMax, whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers, to Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm. The financial terms were not disclosed. G.E. bought ServiceMax in 2016 for $915 million.

GE Digital, the company said, will begin with yearly revenue of $1.2 billion, much of that software sales to its large base of customers in industries including aviation, electric power and health care.

In a statement, Mr. Culp said, “As an independently operated company, our digital business will be best positioned to advance our strategy to focus on our core verticals to deliver greater value for our customers and generate new value for our shareholders.”
