Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.

For a new feature, “Heroin Addiction Explained: How Opioids Hijack the Brain,” which appears today , Times journalists wanted to approach the opioid crisis from an underrepresented perspective: to illustrate, in pictures and words, what each step of the cycle of addiction actually feels like to those who experience it.

The reporters Shreeya Sinha and Jennifer Harlan interviewed more than a dozen current and former opioid users about the most personal aspects of their experiences: their thoughts, feelings and physical sensations while using drugs. They synthesized those descriptions into a seven-stage explainer — gateway, tolerance, withdrawal, addiction, treatment, relapse, recovery — that aims to help readers understand more clearly what addicts go through. When it came to the visuals for the piece, Meghan Louttit, the Times editor who organized the package, and the art director Rumsey Taylor wanted to create a new kind of illustration that would equally foreground the interviewees’ own subjective experiences.

First, the editors read Ms. Sinha and Ms. Harlan’s interviews with the subjects. Then, the Times video journalist Leslye Davis worked with the freelance software artist Zach Lieberman to develop an idea: Ms. Davis would film a dancer, Bailey Anglin, to interpret the interviewees’ words through movement. Then, Mr. Lieberman would manipulate those video clips — adding an aura, for example, to illustrate the warm thrall of an initial high; layering the video with spiky, discordant static to get across the pain of withdrawal.
