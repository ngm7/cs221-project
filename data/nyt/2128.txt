There are plenty of costs: ballot printing, cyber security protections, staff at polling locations and voter file maintenance, to name a few. In many jurisdictions, school board elections, special City Council races and all kinds of other local contests are held throughout the year — not just in even-numbered Novembers — making elections a year-round job.

How all those election costs are handled varies between states. (This report by the National Conference of State Legislatures offers a really good primer on the different laws.)

But there is one cost the federal government shouldered during the midterms: Air Force One. According to an analysis by Quartz, the more than 40 political rallies attended by President Trump during the midterms cost more than $17 million in air travel alone.

When presidents use the plane for campaign purposes, their political party or re-election campaign is supposed to cover a portion of the operating costs. So far, the Trump campaign has reimbursed the Treasury just $112,000 for air travel in March and April, according to the report.

Hey, big spender

Now that we have the full picture of midterm spending from the F.E.C., we asked Rachel to delve into the numbers. Here’s some of what we found:

• Rick Scott, the incoming Republican senator from Florida, had the most money of any candidate in the country, bringing in nearly $84 million. That includes nearly $64 million of his own money — the most any candidate spent on their own campaign this year.

• As expected, Beto O’Rourke, the Texas Democrat, raised the most from contributions, bringing in nearly $81 million.

• On the House side, Representative Devin Nunes, a Trump ally, raised the most, nearly $13 million. His total was followed by his Democratic challenger, Andrew Janz, who raised about $9 million. (This excludes candidates who self-funded.)
