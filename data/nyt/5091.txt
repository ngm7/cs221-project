For all that recognition, though, “Justin Cartwright is surprisingly little known in the United States,” the novelist Tony Eprile wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2006, “although in England he is frequently mentioned alongside authors like Ian McEwan, Martin Amis and Kazuo Ishiguro.”

Image Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called Mr. Cartwright’s “The Promise of Happiness,” winner of the 2005 Hawthornden Prize, a “beautifully observed, emotionally detailed novel.”







The critic Robert E. Hosmer Jr., reviewing “Look at It This Way” (1993), a dark comedy about an American expatriate writer in London, wrote in The Boston Globe that Mr. Cartwright “knows how to plot intricately and tightly, juggling several plots magically interwoven.”

Mr. Cartwright said his books were largely about people struggling to find their place in the world. “I write from what I take to be the realist’s point of view, looking at life as it really is, or the way I see it to be,” he said in an interview with The Telegraph in 2004.

He made extensive use of his South African background in “White Lightning” (2002), in which a soft-core pornographic film director returns to South Africa as his mother there is his dying, and in “Up Against the Night” (2015), a fusion of stories about a wealthy Cape Town-born Londoner in the 21st century and the massacre of the Boer leader Piet Retief and his men by the Zulu king Dingane in 1838.

“I have a theory that I haven’t heard aired before,” Mr. Cartwright told The Irish Times in 2015, referring to the massacre. “This might have been the start of apartheid. Not literally. But I think the Boers were terrified that if you didn’t keep black people under control, this would happen again; they’d come and kill our wives and daughters and children.”
