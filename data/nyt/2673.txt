In 2003, fresh out of school with an art degree, Michael Kravit moved to an artist’s loft in Dumbo, a sixth-floor walk-up. “I find a lot of artistic inspiration in Dumbo,” he said. “It is super-gritty, and I love that.”

His apartment included a “kibathroom,” a closet-style enclosure that was part kitchen and part shower/toilet. He didn’t mind the noise of the elevated subways roaring over the Manhattan Bridge, but overnight visitors couldn’t sleep.

At the time, Mr. Kravit was the art director of The L Magazine. He later moved to Washington, D.C., where he was the creative director of the organic-beverage company Honest Tea. That’s where he met Ian Cummins, who soon headed to business school at New York University. Mr. Kravit followed two years later, and the couple settled in Dumbo in 2015, renting a one-bedroom for around $3,800 a month in the towering J Condominium, which opened in 2006.
