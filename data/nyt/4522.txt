“This is my first interview in nearly 10 years,” David Lee Roth said one recent morning.

The Van Halen frontman’s trademark mane has been shorn to a bleach-blond crop, but neither time nor the long interval between interviews has mellowed Mr. Roth much. He shoulder-shimmied in the middle of Harry Cipriani and, in short order, suggested shots of Patrón.

Specifically, Mr. Roth had come to talk about his newly introduced skin care line, called Ink the Original, which was created for people with tattoos. He came up with the idea himself, he said — a passion project born of his dissatisfaction with the options in the marketplace.

And though he tends to vacillate between pithy slogans (“tattoos make the sidewalk much more entertaining,” he said) and meandering anecdotes (his time as an E.M.T. in New York City in the 1990s contributed to who he is today, he said), it turns out that Mr. Roth is a man with fearsome focus.

He worked with labs on various formulations to develop the products that make up the Ink line: an SPF stick ($28); an SPF spray ($24 and up); and a tattoo-brightening balm with vitamin C ($40). Moreover, he obsessed over the utilitarian packaging and clear satin finish, in part because of his stickler of a mother.
