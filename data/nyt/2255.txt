Tom Steyer, the Democratic billionaire who has paid for television ads calling for the impeachment of President Trump, is also considering a run for president himself. And he is taking a novel approach to staffing up a potential campaign for 2020: An anonymous LinkedIn page advertising “state director” jobs in three of the first four states that will kick off the nominating contest.

“A high profile political campaign based on the West Coast is seeking highly skilled political professionals to join our national campaign team,” the job description begins.

It describes “state director” posts in Nevada, South Carolina and New Hampshire.

Nowhere is Mr. Steyer’s name mentioned in the posting. But the language and structure matches verbatim those of job opportunities listed with one of Mr. Steyer’s other political efforts, NextGen America. Both seek, for instance, “prior training in anti-oppression, equity and inclusion organizing.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. Steyer, Aleigha Cavalier, acknowledged that he was responsible for the LinkedIn advertisement.
