Boska Holland, a Dutch company founded in 1896, specializes in utensils for cheese. More recently, it added tools for chocolate. Its products are widely available, but Boska has also opened its NoMad showroom to retail customers. There, youâ€™ll find a knife for every cheese and special chocolate gadgets. Their new porcelain double-walled chocolate fondue pot and warmer is particularly effective. They also make raclette melters, from the small and portable to industrial-size models.
