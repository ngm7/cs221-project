Dear Match Book,

I have a 7-year-old son who reads at a middle-school level. I am confident that he read more than 50 books this summer; we were making twice-weekly trips to the library to keep him sated. He has read nearly every series book out there for children in kindergarten through third or fourth grade. Our problem is finding books that are just right for his ability, yet avoid romance, bad language or rude behavior disguised as being cool.

I have discouraged him from picking up Jeff Kinney’s “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” books for these reasons. He devoured Lincoln Peirce’s “Big Nate” books before I realized they were likely a bit mature for him. His interests tend toward fantasy and comedy. I try not to police his personal reading and make sure he gets the good stuff during our bedtime read-aloud sessions.

His three favorite series are: “The 13-Story Treehouse,” by Andy Griffiths, illustrated by Terry Denton; “The Extraordinary Adventures of Ordinary Boy,” by William Boniface, illustrated by Stephen Gilpin; and “The Genius Files,” by Dan Gutman. He also loves Judd Winick’s graphic novels starring Hilo, and the “Mighty Jack” adventure tales by Ben Hatke. Illustrated and straight prose suggestions are both welcome.

Dear Lesley,

Sustaining a fast reader can feel like volunteering at a marathon refueling station, handing off books instead of water as your fleet page turner slows, briefly, at your pit stop.
