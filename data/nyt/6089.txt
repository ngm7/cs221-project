Extreme weather conditions led the California Olive Ranch in Chico, Calif., to take the unusual step of making a line of California extra-virgin olive oils blended with oils from other countries. The Destination Series — Everyday, Mild & Buttery and Rich & Robust — was created to convey the same flavor profiles as the company’s previous 100 percent California oils, which had the same names as these new blends. The move offsets a harvest that Gregg Kelley, the company’s chief executive, called “a disaster” because of the unseasonably cold winter of 2017-18. Collaborations with growers in Argentina, Chile and Portugal were developed several years ago in anticipation of olive harvest problems. The company blended the oil with the aim of not letting any region’s characteristics dominate, though Mr. Kelley said at least 26 percent of the oil in each bottle is from California, making it the largest component by just a shade. The oils are reasonably priced, like the ones they replace, and pleasant but hardly distinctive, with the one called Everyday the most useful for many cooking purposes. The company still makes more expensive 100 percent California oils.
