“Swimming With Men” is a British boys club comedy with a fixation on flesh. Refreshingly in this film, though, it is men of a certain age who are the ones exposed.

Eric (Rob Brydon) is an accountant plagued by insecurities. He nearly ruins his marriage by accusing his wife of cheating, and at the office, he struggles to stand up to his slippery superiors. The one place where he finds rest is the local pool where he swims alone. His despondency does not go unnoticed. The pool is home to a synchronized swimming team, made up of middle-aged men who swim together to combat life’s loneliness.
