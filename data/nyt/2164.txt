Good morning. I started messing with firm tofu when I was working on this recipe for velvet fish and mushrooms a few months ago. I’ve since moved on to harder stuff.

I like, for instance, Kay Chun’s recipe for tofu katsu with lemon-tahini sauce (above). Kay calls for the use of firm tofu. Try it with extra-firm, though, and it’s even nicer. Same deal, though a little more involved on the cooking front, with this General Tso’s Tofu Sub. And with Mark Bittman’s ma-po tofu as well. Make it with extra-firm tofu, and experience a kind of perfection.

So tofu’s on the menu this week for sure. If the extra-firm’s just not for you, though, head in the other direction and whisk some silken tofu into a pot of this crazy Korean-Italian-Chinese ragu that the chefs David Chang and Tien Ho invented many, many years ago at Momofuku Ssam Bar. That’s really, really good.

Did you know that today is the chef Bobby Flay’s birthday? He is 54 and owns racehorses and doesn’t need a gift from you or even a card. But you could cook one of the recipes of his that we’ve gathered over the years and adapted for cooking at home, and if you send me a photograph of your work, I’ll pass it along to him, along with your regards: foodeditor@nytimes.com.
