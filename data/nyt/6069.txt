The week between Christmas and New Year’s always feels longer than it is. Unless you’re the stock market, you probably haven’t moved much (in my case, gingerbread rum balls are the culprit). And even if you managed to haul yourself into the office, no one responded to your emails (sorry).

If you’re feeling stir crazy, just remember: Soon it’ll be January, and you’ll look back on these slow, sugar-addled days with fondness. Get ready to hit the ground running by catching up on the top stories in business and tech, plus what’s coming up later this week. Then proceed to revel in your final hours of sloth before those resolutions officially kick in. Happy New Year, everyone.

Dec. 23-29

What’s Up?

Stocks on the Fritz

If you didn’t pay attention to the stock market last week, your blood pressure is surely better for it — although I can’t speak for the effects of your Christmas cookie consumption. To recap: Your portfolio went for a ride when markets neared bear territory on Monday, rocketed back up on Wednesday (the S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day leap since 2009), and wobbled on Friday, closing slightly lower. Why all the theatrics? You can guess the usual suspects, including rising interest rates and the ongoing trade tensions with China, as well as the federal government shutdown — more on that in a minute. Analysts believe the volatility reflects general unease about the economy going into 2019. Brace your 401(k)’s, everybody.
