CHICAGO — A procession of police cars snaked through this city’s streets before dawn on Tuesday, guiding to the morgue the bodies of two Chicago police officers who were struck and killed by a train while chasing someone believed to have fired a gun.

The deaths Monday night of the two officers, Conrad Gary and Eduardo Marmolejo, were the latest in a series of losses for the Chicago Police Department in 2018 — a year Eddie Johnson, the police superintendent, described as “immensely difficult” during an emotional news conference.

Last month, Officer Samuel Jimenez, who had joined the department last year and had recently finished his probationary period, was shot and killed after a man opened fire in a hospital. And in February, a Chicago police commander, Paul R. Bauer, was shot and killed during a confrontation with a man on a busy downtown workday, not far from City Hall.

Officers Gary and Marmolejo were killed instantly on Monday evening, the authorities said, after they were hit by a passenger train on the city’s far South Side. The officers, who were working as partners, were answering a report of gunshots after the city’s ShotSpotter technology detected the gunfire.
