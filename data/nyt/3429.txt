“I would appreciate anything she can do, and I would think that she would want to resolve the family problems,” he said of the queen.

“All families, royal or not, are the same, and they should all be together, certainly around the holidays,” he added. Addressing the fact the duchess is pregnant, he said he hoped to meet his future grandchild.

One of the “Good Morning Britain” interviewers, Piers Morgan, might not have been the most impartial host — a fact noted by many people who criticized him on social media. Mr. Morgan recently wrote a scornful column in the tabloid The Daily Mail claiming that he and the duchess had been friends when she was known as an actress, but that she had shunned, or “ghosted” him after she met the prince.

After lavishing positive attention on the duchess, the notoriously fickle British tabloids have turned on her, reporting that she was feuding with her sister-in-law, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and that she had been “difficult” with palace staff.

In his 18-minute interview on Monday, her father rose to her defense.

“I can’t see her being rude to anybody,” he said. “She’s always been a very controlling person, that’s part of her nature, but she’s never been rude.”

A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said there would be no royal comment on Mr. Markle’s interview.
