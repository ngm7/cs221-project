The Atlanta rapper 21 Savage, fresh from a controversy over an anti-Semitic lyric, opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s latest album chart, while holiday streaming sent Nat King Cole to the Top 10 for the first time in 53 years.

21 Savage’s album, “I Am > I Was” (Slaughter Gang/Epic) — you can read that title as “I Am Greater Than I Was” — reached the top spot with the equivalent of 131,000 sales in the United States, most of that coming from streams, according to data from Nielsen.

Last week 21 Savage briefly flashed through the social media outrage cycle when LeBron James quoted a lyric from one of the songs on “I Am > I Was,” writing on Instagram: “We been getting that Jewish money/Everything is Kosher.” (This was a day after James said N.F.L. team owners have a “slave mentality.”) Both men subsequently made statements, with 21 Savage tweeting, “I’m sorry if I offended everybody never my intention I love all people.”
