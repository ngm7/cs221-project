Barry Jenkins’s adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, “If Beale Street Could Talk,” is an opportunity to revisit an author, an era and a set of themes that still reverberate today. The movie (closely following the book) tells the love story of Fonny and Tish, young people in early 1970s New York City negotiating an impossible situation. Fonny, an enigmatic, Greenwich Village sculptor, has been falsely accused of rape, sending him through a gauntlet of racist institutions as he and Tish try to maintain their deep love. It’s a vision of black life in the city at a moment of change, as the achievements of the Civil Rights movement have begun to curdle. It’s about the persistence of community and solidarity in the face of prejudice. And it captures Baldwin’s genius: illuminating the bruising, personal toll that American society often exacts.

Around the same time he wrote “If Beale Street Could Talk,” Baldwin was working on “Little Man, Little Man,” an enigmatic picture book pitched halfway between children’s and adult literature. The story, which was written for Baldwin’s nephew, centers on a 4-year-old named T.J. who lives in Harlem and loves playing ball with his friends, but also has to navigate a neighborhood where drug addiction and police violence are daily realities.
