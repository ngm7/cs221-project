A passenger train collided head-on with a maintenance locomotive in Ankara, Turkey, Thursday morning, and officials said that at least nine people had been killed, with dozens of others injured.

The crash pushed two carriages of the train off the track, where they smashed into the support legs of an elevated covered walkway, causing it to collapse onto the train. Parts of the train and the walkway also struck and damaged a nearby building.

Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told the broadcaster NTV that 84 people had been injured, including two who were in critical condition.

The leader of a railroad employeesâ€™ union said the line should not have been operating because the area did not have an automated signal system, leaving it to traffic controllers and train drivers to coordinate movements.
