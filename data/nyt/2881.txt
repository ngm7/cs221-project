Mr. Hinojosa pointed out that closing a school is “very traumatic to a community.” In the most recent New Orleans closures, some residents have opposed the decisions because they can prevent parents from enrolling their children in schools near home.

“People care about our business because we deal with their two most prized possessions: Their kids and their money; so they’re going to be very engaged in what we do,” Mr. Hinojosa said.

Mr. Dobard stressed that closing a school was “one of the most difficult things to have to do” as schools chief.

“I didn’t take it lightly,” Mr. Dobard said. “Children should not have to languish in chronically underperforming situations.”

The Louisiana Legislature created the statewide Recovery School District in 2003 to intervene at the state’s lowest performing schools. The Recovery School District’s role includes merging or closing schools, or transforming a school into a charter.

Mr. Dobard became the superintendent of New Orleans’ Recovery School District in 2012, seven years after the Louisiana Legislature expanded the recovery district’s role post-Katrina by shifting control of more than 100 of the city’s low-performing public schools. Mr. Dobard helped transform the agency into a district that oversees independent charters.
