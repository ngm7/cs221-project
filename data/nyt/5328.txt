Arnon Harari has traversed the globe — but not in search of adventure

“I think my life is from girl to girl,” Mr. Harari, 64, said with a sly smile in an interview this month.

At 22, after a stint as a technician in the Israel Defense Forces, Mr. Harari left his home country for the United States, inspired in large part by one of his brothers, a professional dancer.

“He came back to Israel with all these beautiful stories of the world,” Mr. Harari said. “You get attracted to all that. Not to mention that he came home with a blonde.”

In Los Angeles, where Mr. Harari settled, he met a woman who accepted his marriage proposal after a three-day courtship. They had a daughter and moved to New York, where Mr. Harari worked as a computer technician and dabbled in public relations.
