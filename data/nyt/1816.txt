Book Review

A review on Nov. 18 about the audio version of “The Tattooist of Auschwitz,” a novel by Heather Morris, misidentified one of the historical figures who appear in the book. He is the Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss, not Rudolf Hess, who was deputy leader of the Nazi Party.

The Magazine

An article on Nov. 25 about the effect of biofuel policy and palm-oil production on climate change included an erroneous description of a 2008 article in the journal Science. The article noted that when the ripple effects of land use were included, corn-based ethanol — not the use of biodiesel — would nearly double the greenhouse-gas emissions of conventional fuels.

An article on Dec. 2 about the decline of insect populations misidentified, on first reference, the location of Radboud University. It is in the Netherlands, not Denmark. The article also misspelled the name of an extinct species. It is Steller’s sea cow, not Stellar’s.

Travel

An article on Nov. 25 about the Shetland Islands described incorrectly the municipal services on the smaller islands of Yell and Unst. Both have a school, a health clinic and a police station; it is not the case that they are lacking them. The article also misspelled surnames of a writer who set a series of murder mysteries on the Shetland Islands and the owner of Uradale Farm. The author is Ann Cleeves, not Cleaves, and the farm owner is Ronnie Eunson, not Euston.
