SKATE KITCHEN (2018) on Hulu. In her 2015 debut film, “The Wolfpack,” the filmmaker Crystal Moselle documented the lives of a set of siblings whose youths took place almost entirely within the confines of one Manhattan apartment. “Skate Kitchen,” her second feature, concerns a group of adolescents coming of age in another urban setting: a skate park on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Centered on a fictionalized version of the New York skate collective Skate Kitchen — and featuring an acting ensemble made up largely of members of that collective — the movie follows a young skater, Camille (Rachelle Vinberg), who rebels against her restrictive mother by taking the Long Island Rail Road into Lower Manhattan, where she finds solace in the support of fellow Instagram-loving skaters and strikes up a romance with a young photographer played by Jaden Smith. “Older New Yorkers often wax nostalgic about places that were important to them and are gone, and grouse that the city doesn’t have the same ‘magic’ that it used to,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “This movie is a useful reminder that each subsequent generation of New York children gets the city’s magic where they find it.”
