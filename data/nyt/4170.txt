When it comes to postwar art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art rarely lets you breathe easy for long. Just when it hits a good phase, it suddenly changes course and more than likely shoots itself in the foot. Things were really looking up at the Met Breuer, with its superbly installed recent exhibition of Jack Whitten’s sculpture. Then the Met suddenly pulled out of the last three years of its eight-year lease there. It cut short a project that was producing results, giving the Met’s 20th-century curators sustained access to larger and better-designed galleries.

And there’s more to worry about than just exhibitions, as has been made clear with the dismaying “Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera,” a long-term display of nearly 60 works drawn mostly from the Met’s permanent collection. This show creates the impression that despite the Met’s expertise in every other area of art, it frequently seems clueless and guided more by fashion than imagination when it comes to its collecting of postwar art.

As a title, “Epic Abstraction” is overblown, especially once you see the show, which contains plenty that is modest. The phrase “Epic Abstraction” seems to be an attempt to rename the heroics that began with Abstract Expressionism, and now are supposedly continuing in an art world with a widening canon — one much more diverse and inclusive of women and artists of color.
