Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and one of the leaders in Congress’s examination of the sexual abuse problem in Olympic sports, on Tuesday formally asked the F.B.I. to investigate the United States Olympic Committee and U.S.A. Gymnastics based on what he called “their role in this massive cover-up” involving the longtime gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar.

“As you know, accomplice liability is a federal crime,” Senator Blumenthal wrote in a letter to Christopher A Wray, the F.B.I. director, on Tuesday, before urging the Justice Department to investigate “whether the organization is culpable for the harm caused by Nassar.”

Blumenthal, the ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that holds jurisdiction over the U.S.O.C., pushed for the investigation a day after the law firm Ropes & Gray released a 233-page report examining some of the people and entities that enabled Nassar to thrive for decades in the world of sports.

The report, commissioned by the U.S.O.C., was a scathing indictment of a broken system that allowed Nassar to molest girls and women for decades. Investigators found that Scott Blackmun, the U.S.O.C.’s chief executive who resigned in February, did nothing to investigate or stop Nassar in the year or so after he learned of accusations of Nassar’s abuse.
