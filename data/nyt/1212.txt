2. BASIC NEEDS

If HUSBAND enters the domicile and one or more children are hungry, unbathed, tired or running away from the potty in terror, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day. If WIFE is hungry, unbathed or tired because Jacob had his recurring Bobgoblin nightmare the previous night, HUSBAND is similarly prohibited from telling WIFE about his day and is also contractually obligated not to say, “You look tired.”

3. 8.5-BY-11 PLASTIC DIVIDERS

If HUSBAND has forgotten to bring home the 8.5-by-11-inch durable plastic dividers specified by Mrs. Herman at the first-grade parent-teacher meeting, which WIFE attended alone, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day.

4. AFTER SCHOOL

If it is Tuesday or Thursday, the day when WIFE has driven to the other side of town to drop Charlotte off at her Mini Movers class, then circled back to get Jacob to his Gangnam Capoeira hybrid class on time, and then spent the rest of the evening in rush-hour traffic collecting them, HUSBAND is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day and is further required to acknowledge the 1950s cosplay patterns he and WIFE have regrettably fallen into since having children.
