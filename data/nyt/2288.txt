“We ever been to the moon?” he asked.

The others, in unison, agreed that the answer was no.

“They’re going to come get us,” Curry replied. “Sorry, I don’t want to start conspiracies.”

Finberg expressed some skepticism, asking Curry to clarify, and he said he did not believe the United States had landed on the moon, leading to a short discussion of some of the more popular conspiracy theories, including one asserting that the film director Stanley Kubrick had staged the entire thing.

In fact, NASA landed humans on the moon six times from 1969 to 1972, putting a total of 12 astronauts on the lunar surface. It was the only space agency to pull off a piloted mission to the moon, and, after a request from President Trump, NASA is working on plans for another piloted mission in the future.

“We’d love for Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston, perhaps the next time the Warriors are in town to play the Rockets,” said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman. “We have hundreds of pounds of moon rocks stored there, and the Apollo mission control. During his visit, he can see firsthand what we did 50 years ago, as well as what we’re doing now to go back to the moon in the coming years, but this time to stay.”
