Virginia from Virginia extended her arm into this void, found my hand and grasped it. I gained in her a fast friend, fun and fiercely loyal, despite our differences that drilled down to the core. She was adventurous and a devoted breaker of rules. I was timid and rulebound, always certain God was watching. Everything risky I did in high school somehow started with Virginia. She also taught me what an artichoke is, and that it, like us, has a heart .

I did not know then that Virginia’s family was staunchly Republican, or that she didn’t invite me down South for a holiday for fear that her grandmother would make me enter through the back door. I could not conceive at the age of 16 that speaking in a Southern accent made Virginia feel alien on our New England campus, too. What I knew was that this friendship helped me to remain intact despite the assaults on my sense of self-worth that were rarely intentional but cut just as deeply.

Because of Virginia’s daring, I learned that it was not impossible to eat brownie mix straight from the box instead of following the directions. Today we remain friendly, decades after we graduated from high school. She told me that she sees herself as a fiscal Republican and a social Democrat, and teaches her kids that allies come in all kinds of packages.

The philosopher Alexander Nehamas suggests, in a graceful book, “On Friendship,” that this genre of relationship, though indescribably life transforming, is not readily adaptable to broader political goals. The sphere of friendship, he points out, is intimate and closed by nature, the opposite of what a movement for social change must be. But what if the power of friendship is a quiet movement unto itself, one heart at a time, shrinking the shadows between us?
