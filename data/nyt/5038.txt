Mr. Wilson could quickly sense that, and they went their separate ways.

“You know when people are going through the motions,” Mr. Wilson said, but a year later after they ran into each other in the beach town Fire Island Pines on Long Island, Mr. Wilson decided to try again, asking Mr. Sanders out to dinner in the West Village.

“It was pleasant enough, but he still wasn’t looking for a relationship,” Mr. Wilson said.

In July 2006 that seemed to change when Mr. Wilson ran into Mr. Sanders at an Empire State Pride Agenda tea dance in the Hamptons.

“I was really happy to see him,” said Mr. Sanders, who accepted an invitation to what he thought would be a dinner party at Mr. Wilson’s house a couple of weeks later.

“It was his birthday,” said Mr. Sanders, who recalled thinking, “Oh no, I didn’t bring a present.”

He decided to set things right by asking Mr. Wilson if he could take him out to dinner to celebrate. “That was a good sign,” Mr. Wilson said.

A couple of weeks later, they had a romantic dinner at Wallsé, an Austrian restaurant in the West Village.
