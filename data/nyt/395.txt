Philip Bosco, a character actor who was a familiar face for years in movies, on television and especially on the Broadway stage, where he won a Tony Award and was nominated for five more, died on Monday night at his home in Haworth, N.J. He was 88.

His daughter Celia Bosco said the cause was complications of dementia.

A tall man with a hearty manner and a voice that could shift easily from stentorian boom to silken purr, Mr. Bosco received his first Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut, in 1960, and his last for his role as the angriest member of the jury in a murder trial in the 2004 production of Reginald Rose’s intense drama “Twelve Angry Men.”

Known for his versatility, Mr. Bosco won his one Tony, in 1989, for portraying a buffoonish opera impresario in Ken Ludwig’s farce “Lend Me a Tenor.”

As late as 1979, when he had already appeared in more than 30 Broadway productions, he told The New York Times, with more resignation than rancor, “There are a lot of actors like me who have been working a long time, yet no one knows you outside the theater world.” He added, “You could say all of us are waiting in the wings for that great role.”
