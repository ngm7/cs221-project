Curtis Sittenfeld, the best-selling writer of “Prep” and “Eligible,” is the latest to join a growing number of authors partnering with Audible to produce original stories for the audio storytelling platform. Sittenfeld’s short story, “Atomic Marriage,” read by the actress Diane Lane, will be released by the company on Jan. 4.

“Atomic Marriage” was not originally written with audio in mind. Sittenfeld, who wrote “American Wife,” a novel based on Laura Bush’s life, had been approached by Tyler Cabot, deputy editor of Audible Originals, a year earlier to write a story about Melania Trump. “I said, ‘No, thank you,’” Sittenfeld recalled when we spoke on the phone this week. But she kept Audible in the back of her mind, noticing the company’s willingness to experiment with new writers and forms.

“It’s fun to try something new as a writer,” she said, so when she wrote “Atomic Marriage,” she asked Cabot if Audible wanted to release it.
