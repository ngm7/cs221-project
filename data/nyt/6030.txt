After working several scenes and breaking for hand-rolled cigarettes — “Take 10 minutes. American minutes, not Palestinian minutes,” Mr. Zuabi called after his departing actors — they sat in a rough circle with Ms. Aron and discussed the particular challenges the play presented.

Two years ago, Ms. Aron, a producer and director who first learned of the Palestinian theater scene while directing in Israel in the mid-’90s, and Mr. Zuabi began to talk about a commissioned piece. It would explore, Ms. Aron said, “this question of what influence the U.S. has had on Palestine, on thinking and consciousness and not in just a political way.”

“Don’t get arrogant,” Mr. Zuabi chided. “It’s not a one-way relationship.” (As he later explained in an email: “Our land has produced the foundation blocks of Western civilization. The idea of one god was hatched in our neck of the woods.”)

There were straightforward ways to approach this relationship. “You’re aiding our occupiers with lots of money and weapons,” Mr. Zuabi said. But while he isn’t shy about articulating his politics — “I’m very anti-Israel, I’m occupied and I don’t like it” — polemics don’t interest him artistically.

He began to think instead about the 1969 moon landing. “It’s a moment that encapsulates all of the American values,” he said, adding, “the bravura, the nothing-is-impossible attitude, the technological superiority.”

“It’s almost a reversal of who we are,” he said. So what would it mean for a Palestinian man to attempt it?

Beginning in December 2016, Mr. Zuabi began workshops and structured improvisations in Haifa, Bethlehem, Jenin and Ramallah with the explicit goal of finding a diverse group of Palestinian actors. Once a shortlist of actors had been assembled, the visa process to come to the United States began.
