Seth MacFarlane’s “Star Trek” sendup returns to Fox. And an adaptation of an Aravind Adiga novel debuts on Netflix.

What’s on TV

THE ORVILLE 8 p.m. on Fox. When this series debuted last year, it marked a bit of a departure for Seth MacFarlane, the “Family Guy” funnyman. The high-energy, animated vulgarity of that show and MacFarlane’s “American Dad” is dialed down here, replaced with drier humor and a heavy helping of “Star Trek” — which is being parodied. MacFarlane plays the captain of a spaceship and crew in uniforms who shoot blasters that would blend right in at a Trekkie convention. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the show “emulates the original ‘Trek’ series to a degree somewhere between sincere homage and creepy necrophilia.” It returns for a second season after a yearlong hiatus.

SPACE JAM (1996) 10 p.m. on VH1. This quintessential ’90s kids movie places an animated Bugs Bunny alongside Michael Jordan. Danny DeVito voices the bad guy.
