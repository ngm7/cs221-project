Ralph Koltai, an innovative set designer who gave an abstract, often startling look to hundreds of major theatrical, balletic and operatic productions in England, the United States and elsewhere, died on Dec. 15 in Châtellerault, France. He was 94.

Pamela Howard, a friend and fellow designer, said he died at a hospital after a short illness.

Mr. Koltai, who emigrated from Germany as a teenager just before World War II and later was part of the British team at the Nuremberg trials, was one of the most influential stage designers of the second half of the 20th century, helping to move theater and opera sets away from mere utility and realism and toward interpretation and statement-making. It was not uncommon for an audience to gasp collectively upon first sight of one of his sets.

For the 1972 premiere of Peter Maxwell Davies’s “Taverner” at the Royal Opera House in London, he devised a giant mechanical seesaw that suggested the scales of justice. For the English National Opera’s “Ring” cycle in the 1970s, he used metallic tubes and spheres to create a space-age look that, as the opera critic Hugh Canning later put it, was “futuristic but paradoxically timeless.” And for a Royal Shakespeare Company “Much Ado About Nothing” that made Broadway in 1984, he used a maze of reflecting surfaces, including a mirrored floor, to convey that, as Frank Rich put it in his review in The New York Times, “in ‘Much Ado,’ appearances are everything — and are almost always deceiving.”

The goal, Mr. Koltai often said, was to enhance, not merely to be functional.

“I still think we have a habit of treating scenery like scenery rather than helping the actor and director to make a statement,” he told The Times in a 1984 interview. “I try and find ways of introducing art into theater, and occasionally I get somewhere near.”
