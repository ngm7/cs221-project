Good morning. Christmas is coming and the tree we usually get on the day after Thanksgiving is still sitting lonely on the lot where the Quebecers come every year to sell their greens. We need to hang garlands, drape twinkling lights, put up the mistletoe and holly, turn the amaryllis so it gets better light and blooms big next weekend, to welcome St. Nick. There are gifts to buy, a tourtière to assemble for Christmas Eve, a ham to secure for the following day. Also, the truck needs an oil change.

But, man, it’d be nice not to do any of that. It’d be nice to fry chicken today, eat coleslaw, biscuits, drain a couple of Mexican cokes, kick back and relax as if it were July somewhere with live oaks and a warm breeze off the ocean.

So I think you should do just that. Monday you can eat a little more mindfully, perhaps with Julia Moskin’s recipe for a big salad with grains (above). I like it with Ali Slagle’s recipe for a lemon-caper dressing.

For Tuesday, scallops with cider glaze and cauliflower, a recipe Alex Witchel secured from the chef Floyd Cardoz back in 2011, right before he opened North End Grill in Manhattan.
