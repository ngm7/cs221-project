If you’re looking for me this month, chances are I’m parked under a cable-knit blanket happily consuming holiday movies at the same rate as gingerbread cookies and spiked punch from Trader Joe’s.

I relish eye-rolling my way through saccharine plotlines that so often hinge on women who don’t even know what they’re missing: that is, a man (who’s also often, gasp, a prince).

Even beyond Lifetime and Hallmark, the “good” Christmas movies — I’m looking at you, “Love Actually” — are often just as bad at representing self-reliant female characters with some semblance of agency. And in times like these, when pop culture and #MeToo are inextricable, holiday fare is also not free of scrutiny. (“Baby, It’s Cold Outside” was yanked from some radio stations this year for lyrics that to some “sound like a prelude to date rape,” my colleague recently wrote.)
