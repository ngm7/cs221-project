The Independent Review Panel commissioned to address concerns over match-fixing in tennis published its final report on Wednesday after nearly three years of investigating the problem.

The panel issued a preliminary report in April, after which it consulted with the tennis governing bodies and their watchdog group, the Tennis Integrity Unit, about the implementation of its 12 recommendations.

The panel said there could be “no simple solution or panacea to deal with the problem now faced.”

“The nature of the game lends itself to manipulation for betting purposes,” the report said. “There are many contingencies. There is only one player who must act. Detection is difficult, not least because at many lower level matches there are no spectators and inadequate facilities to protect players from potential corrupters. Moreover, underperformance is often attributed to ‘tanking,’ which too often has been tolerated.”

The panel cited an incentive structure in which many players with little hope of professional advancement can be tempted into accepting offers to contrive outcomes in matches, which often exceed the paltry compensation for winning matches. The report encouraged the tennis tours “to create a player pathway that ensures sufficient financial incentives and prospects for progression.”
