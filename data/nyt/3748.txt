Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams opened the Red Cat in 1999, on the west side of 10th Avenue north of 23rd Street, just south of a carwash. The restaurant was meant to evoke, Mr. Bradley said, New England by way of Paris, and his cooking did the same, with side trips all over the world. The restaurant evinced a particular kind of New York elegance: confident and relaxed, witty, not too formal but not informal, either.

“The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike,” Frank Bruni, then the restaurant critic for The New York Times, wrote in a two-star review in 2005, “except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood.”

Mr. Bradley’s current mood is both cheerful and elegiac. He is closing the restaurant on Dec. 23, and heading home to Rhode Island, and from there to parts unknown. He wasn’t facing a rent increase or a slump in business. (He and Mr. Abrams dissolved their partnership years ago.) Mr. Bradley just wanted to quit: 51 years old, Generation X, raised at the nexus of hippies and punk.

“It’s time for something new,” he said recently, his eyes laughing, as if he were Buddha, or a drummer with a line on a place to stay. “I don’t know what it is, and I’m not going looking for it. It’s going to come.”
