OAKLAND, Calif. — The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, but lost LeBron James — at least for the time being.

After leading the Lakers to a sizable lead, James left the game in the third quarter with what the team described as a strained left groin. He did not return, but the Lakers had no trouble pulverizing the Warriors without him, rolling to a 127-101 victory, their first win at Oracle Arena since December 2012.

There was obvious cause for concern for the Lakers not only because James is one of the greatest players of his generation but also because he is one of its most durable. Coach Luke Walton said James would undergo a magnetic resonance imaging exam on Wednesday to determine the extent of the injury; Walton did not offer a timetable for his return.

“Just overextended my groin, I guess,” said James, who did not rule out playing on Thursday against the Sacramento Kings. “It’s unfortunate.”
