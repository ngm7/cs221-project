When the United States beat the reigning champion, Japan, in the 2015 Women’s World Cup final, it felt like a high-water moment. Over 25 million people watched — the largest ever for a broadcast of American soccer, male or female. I worried that women’s soccer would then retreat back into the shadows, with no one following it until the next World Cup or Olympic cycle. But since that milestone, the women’s soccer world has been, to my great surprise, full of good news.

Looking ahead to the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France, I expect it to get even better.

In this era of outright hope in the women’s game, the United States is still the beacon. But it’s not just here: After decades of neglect, federations and clubs have poured money into the women’s game. More and more women from around the world are able to make a living playing the sport. Some professional teams in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico are even offering college scholarships to their players — following the United States’ precedent of preparing players for futures beyond soccer.
