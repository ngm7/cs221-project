Growing up in southern Indiana, Benjamin W. Bradley was somewhat isolated and, as a teenager, besotted with Christmas and its trappings. One year, he unwrapped a gift from his mother and was delighted to find a cylindrical lamp, decorated with Santa and his sleigh; heat from a bulb inside set the image spinning as if by magic. Mr. Bradley learned years later that the gift he’d been given was a rare Econolite motion lamp.

Later, on holiday break from Purdue University, he received a copy of a reference work, “Christmas Collectibles” by Margaret and Kenn Whitmyer.

It “opened up a whole world for me, with information on the things I collected” or dreamed of owning, Mr. Bradley said. “I’d spend hours looking over photos in this book. I still do.”
