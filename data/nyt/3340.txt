Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the Interior, is the second devoted cheerleader for President Trump’s boneheaded strategy of “energy dominance” to be ushered out the door. The first was Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Like Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke leaves under a cloud of possible ethical violations. Also like Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke promoted the rapid development of fossil fuels — coal in Mr. Pruitt’s case, oil and gas in Mr. Zinke’s — at a time when nearly every reputable scientist says that the world needs to produce and consume less of these fuels, not more, and swiftly replace them with carbon-free alternatives to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

Unfortunately for the environmental community, not to mention the health of the planet, there is likely to be little change in policy at the Interior Department, just as there was no fundamental change at the E.P.A., where Andrew R. Wheeler, an industry lobbyist, replaced Mr. Pruitt. Mr. Zinke’s second in command and possible successor is David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist and an oil and gas man to the core.

And lest we forget, the policy is synonymous with Mr. Trump himself: His appointees in the environmental arena were chosen for their fealty to the America First energy strategy contained in a series of executive orders early in his presidency aimed at rolling back just about every useful thing President Barack Obama had done to combat global warming and protect priceless public lands from commercial intrusion.

Despite serving less than two years, Mr. Zinke racked up an impressive number of ethics investigations. At last count, his leadership had spurred some 15 inquiries into a colorful array of purported misbehavior ranging from conflicts of interest to the misuse of taxpayer funds to violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal officials from using their positions to influence elections.
