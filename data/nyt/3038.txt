So, too, did Barcelona, the only one of the trio of perennial Champions League favorites to have come close to impressing in the group stage. Same old, same old: Between them, Real, Bayern and Barcelona account for eight of the last 10 winners. And they are all in position again.

Or so it seems. Group stage form is rarely a reliable guide to eventual success — Real, in particular, has an uncanny ability to discover not just a new gear but an entirely different engine when the knockout rounds start — but it is obvious that all three are not at the peak of their powers.

Those two defeats to CSKA aside, Real’s European form has provided an escape from their domestic travails. Bayern wallows nine points behind Borussia Dortmund at the summit of the Bundesliga. Barcelona has wobbled, occasionally, too. All three are at, or near, to the end of a cycle; Real and Bayern, certainly, are contemplating comprehensive overhauls this summer regardless of how the season turns out.

All of which means that those clubs who have labored in their shadows for a decade have a mouthwatering opportunity: Atlético Madrid and Juventus, each with two losses in the final in the last six years, certainly, but also the supercharged pretenders to the throne: Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.

For both clubs, the Champions League is the Holy Grail — if not for their fans, then certainly for their soft-power-seeking owners. This is the trophy they have spent billions to acquire, the ultimate proof of their transformative power. It is why P.S.G. made Neymar the most expensive player in history, and Kylian Mbappé the second; it is why City designed a whole club just for Pep Guardiola .
