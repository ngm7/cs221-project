Bench by the Plaza

Dear Diary:

While visiting New York a few years ago, I sat down at the end of an empty bench across from the Plaza Hotel to wait for my wife, who was with a friend nearby.

As I watched people coming and going at the Plaza, I felt the presence of someone standing next to me. I turned and saw a small older woman staring at me.

“You are sitting in my place,” she said quietly.

I stood up and offered her the spot where I was sitting.

She thanked me, and I moved to the other end of the bench.

Neither of us spoke another word.
