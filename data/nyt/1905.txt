After Sunday’s huge performance, Cooper has 40 catches for 642 yards and six touchdowns since he joined Dallas, with his arrival bringing balance to a team that previously relied far too much on Ezekiel Elliott’s running. The team is 5-1 since the trade.

“It’s been a dream come true,” Cooper told Fox’s Erin Andrews in an on-field interview just after he made the winning catch. “When I was young and thought about playing in the N.F.L., this was the experience.”

By dispatching the defending Super Bowl champions, the Cowboys have won five consecutive games and are in control of the N.F.C. East, a division that seemed to belong to the Washington Redskins just a few short weeks ago.

Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott struggled a bit with turnovers. He completed 42 of 54 passes for 455 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions and lost a fumble.

But the Cowboys, thanks to a team-record 62-yard field goal by Brett Maher and a great deal of exceptional play from Cooper and Elliott, endured Prescott’s uneven performance.
