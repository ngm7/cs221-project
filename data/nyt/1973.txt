Good Monday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• As President Trump and congressional leaders race to avert a partial government shutdown, one issue in particular is dividing them: Mr. Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a wall on the United States’ southern border. He is set to meet with Democratic leaders on Tuesday.

• In filings last week, prosecutors said Mr. Trump personally directed an illegal scheme to manipulate the 2016 election by silencing two women who say they had affairs with him. Mr. Trump and his team minimized the importance of any potential campaign finance violations. Democrats, however, said they could lead to impeachment.

• Since the early months of the Trump administration, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, has been having private, informal conversations with Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia. It has paid off well for the Saudis.
