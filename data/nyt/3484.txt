While I like running in the cold, even I have limits. I’m less likely to get in a workout if it’s icy out, not just because of the risk of falling (I have Yaktrax ice cleats) but because of drivers who are way too confident in their ability to handle the perils of driving in a blizzard.

So what do you do? A lot of other things:

1. Run on a treadmill.

Yes, yes, I know, I hate it too, but if you’re training for something important (hello all you Boston Marathon runners) and need to get in your miles, this is going to be your best option in bad weather. Over at Trail Runner, David Roche (who is — full disclosure — my coach) wrote a detailed guide to getting the most out of the treadmill. It’s worth a read.

2. Weight training.

You don’t need to become a bodybuilder or even lift the heaviest of weights to get benefits out of pumping some iron — or doing planks or using tension bands. We’ve got a whole guide on how to create a program that works for you, whether you’re going to weight train at the gym or at home.
