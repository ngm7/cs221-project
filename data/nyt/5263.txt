Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday and is recovering at home after undergoing surgery last week to remove two nodules from her left lung, according to Kathleen Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman.

The malignant nodules, discovered in November after Justice Ginsburg fractured her ribs in a fall, were removed Friday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

“There was no evidence of any remaining disease,” Ms. Arberg said in a statement last week, citing Justice Ginsburg’s thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie W. Rusch. “Scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body.”

Despite her hospitalization, Justice Ginsburg, 85, still participated in a Friday court vote preventing the Trump administration from immediately enforcing its new policy of denying asylum to migrants who illegally cross the Mexican border. She is the most senior member of the court’s four-member liberal wing.
