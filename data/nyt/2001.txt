Investors think they hand out money fairly. Not so, a new report says.

A Morgan Stanley survey of 101 investors and 168 bank loan officers indicates that although investors believe their financing decisions are balanced, in reality they are highly skewed:

• Nearly 80 percent said they think minority and women business owners get either the appropriate amount of capital or more, considering what their business models suggest they deserve.

• The median investment by equity investors in all businesses is nearly $1 million. For those owned by women, it’s just $213,000. And for minority-owned companies, it’s $185,000.

A big problem: getting in the door. Investors are nearly three times as likely to review business opportunities pitched by men “very frequently” as those pitched by women — even though men are only 1.5 times more likely to own a business.

• Investors could do more to change the dynamic. Of those polled, nearly 40 percent of men said investing in businesses owned by women was not a priority; 31 percent of white investors said it was not a priority to invest in minority-owned businesses.
