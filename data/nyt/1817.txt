LONDON — After a miserable day for Britain, when the economic and political future of the country remained uncertain and the battle over how to leave the European Union tore politicians apart, the annual Fashion Awards (Britain’s answer to the Met Gala) came as something of a glittering balm Monday night. A red carpet scattered with Swarovski crystals led the way to an evening full of fairy tales and elegance, escapism and surprises.

Starting with the arrival of a beaming Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, wearing a one-shouldered black velvet evening gown and stroking her pregnant belly. Almost all of the 4,000 guests assembled inside the Royal Albert Hall, one of London’s grandest buildings, were stunned when the duchess emerged to present Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director of Givenchy, with the award for British designer of the year for women’s wear. The pairing did make a certain amount of sense, given that Ms. Waight Keller designed the dress the duchess wore when she married Prince Harry in May.

Still, royalty doesn’t often make an appearance at the Fashion Awards, organized annually by the British Fashion Council.
