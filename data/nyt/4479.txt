Are you Christmas shopping?

And for our apartment. We like coming here. Last wear we found a print we put up in our bedroom. And some candle holders.

You have a great deal of denim on.

I do. The jeans I just threw on, they’re comfortable. But I had retired the jacket for the season. It’s my boyfriend’s that I borrow sometimes.

Is he cool with that?

He is, if he doesn’t want to wear it.

That’s nice. What about your scarf?

I’ve had the scarf for probably nine years. It’s from a store called Joyce Leslie, in Connecticut. It’s a place I shopped a lot when I was in college, for going-out clothes.
