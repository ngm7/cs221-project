“I knew that our plans would include an all-new foundation and all-new electrical, plumbing and systems, so I wasn’t too afraid of what we’d discover,” Mr. Feldman said. “We made a pre-emptive offer that was a little bit aggressive.”

The strategy worked, and they closed on the house for about $2.9 million that September. Then the couple toiled on the design for a year and a half, discovering in the process that they had different ideas about exactly what the house should become.

“There was a debate about how modern to make it,” said Mr. Feldman, who is a committed modernist, while his wife’s aesthetic is a little more traditional.

The biggest bone of contention, it turned out, was where to put the staircase.

Like most homes of the period, this one had a staircase near the entrance. Mr. Feldman wanted to move the stairs toward the center of the house, where they could be illuminated with skylights. That way, the entire floor plan could be opened up, bringing in more light everywhere.

“I had a hard time with that in an Edwardian house,” Ms. Lougee said. “That set our project back several months. But eventually I came around, and I’m really glad I did.”

The new blackened-steel-and-glass staircase is now one of her favorite features.

“Once we worked out the stair,” she said, “we were so relieved to have come to an agreement that we were both willing to compromise” on things like the furnishings, where they split the difference, blending modern and traditional pieces, from a sleek B&B Italia sofa to antique bergères.
