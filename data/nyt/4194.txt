Nonetheless, the celebrities were kvelling about the play. “If you liked the novel, it’s as good as having an audiobook with moving pictures,” Samuel L. Jackson said.

His wife, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, stars in the production alongside Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch. Ms. Jackson praised the decision by Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the adaptation, to enhance the role of her character, the Finch family’s maid. “It’s important that these African-American characters are not always seen as scenery, or the backdrop to somebody else’s life,” she said.

Mr. Sorkin, too, seemed satisfied with his work. “My fear was that this would be a suicide mission, that I was going to make it less than what it was originally and reduce the book,” he said, standing beside an enormous vase of plastic flowers. “I don’t think that happened.”

Mr. Daniels, surrounded by his family, recalled his reaction when Mr. Sorkin first mentioned the project two years ago. “It was: ‘Don’t make me read the book if I’m not going to be playing Atticus,’” he said, before adding with a smirk, “Which is like, stupid.”
