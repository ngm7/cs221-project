Wise readers! I’m Raymond Zhong, a Times reporter in China — where, I contend, something is unfolding right now that carries higher stakes than any other tech story on the planet.

I know, I’m biased. But hear me out.

China detained another Canadian citizen this week, the third to have been snatched up in the country this month. Beijing denies it, but most people in China see the detentions as retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The United States has accused Ms. Meng of fraud, and is seeking her extradition. She remains in Canada under round-the-clock surveillance.

In other words, the United States and China’s contest for technological supremacy has now left four lives hanging in the balance — hostages to something much larger than themselves.
