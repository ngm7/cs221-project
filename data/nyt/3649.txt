Pam Williams didn’t love her loft in the Pearl District of Portland, Ore. Its orangy bamboo floors and cabinets didn’t speak to her, nor did the imposing steel ductwork from a previous renovation. To create a place that felt like her own, she figured she would have to move.

Then she saw another apartment in the building.

“It just blew me away,” said Ms. Williams, 74, a retired public library director and widow who volunteers with the Portland Art Museum and the Armory performing arts center. Although her neighbor’s space was similar to hers, it looked like a different world, with a crisp black-and-white color scheme, concrete floors and a pared-down collection of modern yet comfortable furniture.

“I had saved money to buy a new place, and was looking,” Ms. Williams said. “But I started to think maybe it would be wiser to just stay here and have it redone by somebody who could turn it into a real gem.”
