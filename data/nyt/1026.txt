Paul Goldschmidt was a high school senior, watching from the upper deck in Houston, when Albert Pujols blasted a titanic home run for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2005 National League Championship Series. The Cardinals had been one out from elimination, but the great Pujols saved them. St. Louis would lose that series, but Pujols went on to lead them to two World Series titles in later years.

“I had a good view,” Goldschmidt said in an interview a few years ago. “It was crazy. I was like every fan there. I was upset.”

Goldschmidt rooted for the Astros then, and before long he would become an All-Star first baseman for the Arizona Diamondbacks. But with one year to go before he hits free agency, the downsizing Diamondbacks traded Goldschmidt on Wednesday to the Cardinals, who finally found a fearsome slugger to replace Pujols in the middle of their lineup.

In exchange for Goldschmidt, the Diamondbacks acquired starter Luke Weaver, catcher Carson Kelly, the Class AA infielder Andrew Young and a competitive-balance round B draft pick in 2019. Weaver was 7-11 with a 4.95 earned run average last season, and while Kelly has hit only .154 in the majors, he was blocked by Yadier Molina in St. Louis and has ranked among baseball’s best prospects.
