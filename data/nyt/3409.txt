The Dallas Cowboys came into Sunday with plans of securing a division title and extending a lengthy winning streak. They leave Indianapolis trying to figure out what went wrong in an ugly 23-0 loss to the Colts.

From the start, the game belonged to Indianapolis.

On Dallas’s opening drive, Denico Autry, defensive end for the Colts, got a hand on Brett Maher’s 48-yard field goal attempt. Indianapolis wasted no time capitalizing on the Dallas mistake, as Andrew Luck took the team 44 yards on eight plays, with Marlon Mack punching the ball in from one yard out. With that, the message was sent: The Colts were not scared of the Cowboys, and they were going to be aggressive all game.

A fired-up Coach Frank Reich addressed his players in the locker room following the shutout, crediting them with showing no complacency even as they have rapidly improved over the course of this season.

“We said this game right here had to be the best game of the year,” Reich said. “We’d been climbing, climbing, get better, get better, and let us show up on Sunday for the best game of the year.”
