So you’re finally moving out. Your college is pretty far away from where you grew up. Your new roommates seem great. You’re learning to budget and you might finally become vegetarian now. Not to mention the wild parties.

I went through most of this when I left home for the first time and headed to college. I won’t lie, a lot of it was great. But it wasn’t all glamorous.

During the first two years away from my hometown I felt like I was in emotional limbo. One part of me was euphoric to be finally living the kind of life I’d always dreamed of. I was navigating fresh spaces, meeting new people and making a lot of decisions for myself. The other part of me was deeply homesick.
