• A truce in Yemen.

Warring sides of the brutal civil war took their biggest step yet toward peace: a cease-fire in the key port city of Hudaydah.

The U.N. secretary general said the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition agreed to withdraw their forces from the city, which serves as the main conduit for humanitarian aid entering the country. One U.N. official expected the process to begin in the next few days. The two sides also agreed to a prisoner exchange for as many as 15,000 people.

Whether the agreement will hold remains to be seen.

The three-year-long civil war has produced the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing 12 million people to the brink of starvation. The tragedy of the war gained more global attention after the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. Above, the aftermath of an airstike in southern Yemen.

→ In the U.S.: The Senate voted to withdraw American military assistance for Saudi forces in Yemen, delivering a stinging bipartisan rebuke of President Trump’s continued support for the kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Though largely symbolic, the move signaled a growing sense of urgency among lawmakers to punish Saudi Arabia.
