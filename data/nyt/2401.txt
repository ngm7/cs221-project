My name is Alfonso Cuarón. I’m the writer director of “Roma.” This scene takes place deep into the movie. We see our main character, Cleo, who’s a domestic worker working for this middle class family in Mexico City, who’s pregnant. And she’s been taken to this furniture shop to buy a crib for the baby. It’s clear that there’s a lot of activity, and we establish that there is a student demonstration going on. So as they walk towards the furniture shop, they walk in front of riot policemen, but also, a lot of students. You can see them walking with excitement to join the demonstration. In the background, you can hear different chants in support of different affiliations and different universities around the country. And you’ll hear also how they sing the Mexican national anthem. And all of this is taken from historical facts. We see a shot of some window that has a lot of clocks for sale on display. And those are marking the time. And this is important because this is just five minutes before the historical events took place, and I wanted this to be the moment in which the personal and the social come together, and the historical context also then come together. There’s a certain part of existence that you feel that you’re under control. But in my point of view, there is a greater randomness that puts things together or pulls them apart. And finally, the camera reaches the window and looks down into the street to reveal that there’s a paramilitary group attacking the demonstration. And by the way, we shot in the place where the events took place. What you see down on the street, we rehearsed in a football field for many weeks before, because it was going to involve stunts and people running, and I didn’t want any accidents just improvising at the last moment. Because we have close to 1,000 extras down there. So it was a big, big, big operation for us. [speaking spanish]
