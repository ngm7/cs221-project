Ms. Funke said Mr. Barbuti often failed to give her the $150 a week allotted by the court, and that he was late paying bills for her parking garage, car insurance, her phone and internet, and that her supplemental health insurance was expired. In court Mr. Barbuti told the judge that he could not pay some of her bills because she refused to provide them to him.

Some days it seemed like she spent more time fighting with Mr. Barbuti over her bills than it would take to manage them, and they were still a royal mess, she said.

Mr. Barbuti said people had the wrong idea about guardians, that their powers were limited to what the judge gave them. New York also limited runaway fees: if a guardian billed more than $75,000 in a year, he or she could not take any new cases the following year.

“There’s a misconception about guardianship, that somehow or other you become that person’s alter ego,” Mr. Barbuti said. “That’s just not the case. All you can do is what the court tells you you can do.” He added: “I like this kind of work. I feel there’s a chance to help somebody and make a difference in their lives.”

If you were Ms. Funke, shouldn’t you be allowed to withdraw into the covers if you wanted to? And the clutter in your apartment — couldn’t people understand that a writer needs materials around? Even if she were evicted, she had money to start somewhere else. Courts evict people with lots less.

If you were Judge Kelly, what would you do? Would you want to be the judge who left her vulnerable and unprotected?

Mr. Barbuti said the question of guardianship was a complex one.

“People should have the right to make their own decisions, even if you might look at it and I might look at it or a judge might look at it and say that’s not a good decision,” he said. “I don’t think the government should be making decisions like that for people. I think people should be able to make bad decisions. Within bounds.”
