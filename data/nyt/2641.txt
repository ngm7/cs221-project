“THE DAY,” a new work with major collaborators from the worlds of music and dance, will have its premiere next summer at the Jacob’s Pillow dance festival in Becket, Mass.

The idyllic festival in the Berkshires, whose lineup was announced on Wednesday, will run from June 19 through Aug. 25, with five world premieres and return engagements from several Jacob’s Pillow fixtures.

“THE DAY,” which was conceived by the cellist Maya Beiser, will have its premiere on July 31 and run through Aug. 4, and will be performed by her and Wendy Whelan, the former New York City Ballet star who in her retirement has become an ever-busy champion of new dance. The work features choreography by the dance luminary Lucinda Childs and music by the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang (his piece of the same name but styled differently, “the day”).

Among the other premieres is a duet — not yet titled — for the City Ballet principal Sara Mearns and the postmodern choreographer and performer Jodi Melnick. It will be included on the program “Sara Mearns: Beyond Ballet” (Aug. 14-18), showcasing how the dancer has branched out, in recent years, often garnering critical praise; included is the Jacob’s Pillow-commissioned “No. 1,” created with the hip-hop duo Company Wang Ramirez.
