[College Football Playoff: Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Oklahoma are in.]

5 Oklahoma 39, 9 Texas 27

Kyler Murray threw for 379 yards and three touchdowns as No. 5 Oklahoma beat No. 9 Texas in the Big 12 championship game on Saturday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., the Sooners avenging their only loss and making their case for a return to the College Football Playoff.

Murray, the Heisman Trophy-contending dual-threat quarterback, completed 25 of 34 passes and threw two of his touchdowns to Grant Calcaterra. One of those was an impressive one-handed grab for an 18-yard score on third-and-10 with two minutes left as the Sooners (12-1), No. 5 in the playoff rankings, won their seventh consecutive game.

“That catch will live on in Oklahoma history forever,” Coach Lincoln Riley said. “What a play.”

Oklahoma is the first team from a Power Five conference to win four consecutive outright conference titles since Florida did so in the SEC in the mid-1990s.

“We’re thrilled by the victory,” Riley said. “It’s been a challenging year, which they all are. But to sit here now as four-time defending Big 12 champion, man, that sounds good.”
