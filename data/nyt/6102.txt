Re “College Isn’t for Everyone,” by Oren Cass (Op-Ed, Dec. 12):

I was somewhat saddened to read this Op-Ed, which seems to be saying that college is valuable only as it relates to earning power. Of course, having employment and making a decent living wage are important for everyone. But there’s more to college than that. Being exposed to somewhat higher levels of learning — a little literature, slightly advanced sciences, a dash of humanities — are equally important to earning power.

I believe that every high school graduate should have free community college, at least. Some of them will go on to four-year colleges, some will go on to a job, some will probably drop out, but a lot of them will gain something they never experienced before.

Looking back, I think my first two years of college opened more windows for me to a broader look at the world and my place in it than probably any other two years of my life. Let’s give everyone a chance to have at least a little of the brain-opening experience that college can be.

To the Editor:

Oren Cass is absolutely correct that college is not for everyone. Over my 42 years of teaching undergraduates I estimate that at least a third of my students should not have been in college. Either they were not prepared academically, were too immature or were simply not suited for it. Mr. Cass’s idea of providing better options supported by vastly increased public funding would do these students far more good than failing or dropping out of college heavily burdened by debt.
