He, Luba and their son, Simon, then 6, were part of the great wave of Jewish families who left the Soviet Union after emigration rules were relaxed in the 1970s. When they moved to Chicago, they continued speaking Russian at home, so Ms. Morales is fluent in the language as well as in the food.

Now the whole family, as well as a new generation of grandchildren (who were waiting impatiently for the chocolate kolbasa , a fudgy confection that looks like salami, to be served) lives in the Portland area.

But in some ways, the Frumkins remain Russian, and New Year’s Eve remains the biggest holiday of the year: Christmas, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving rolled into one.

The reasons for this go back to the years after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, when the vast properties of the Russian Orthodox Church were nationalized, religious instruction was outlawed and believing in miracles was officially forbidden.

About a decade later, the Soviet regime banned the celebration of Christmas. (Dec. 25 was made a national “day of industrialization,” to be observed by going to work.) New Year’s Eve was declared an official holiday, celebrated at midnight with approved concerts and fireworks. Gradually, Christmas traditions like trees, presents and sweets crept into the New Year’s celebration, including a nonreligious Santa figure called Grandfather Frost who hands out gifts with the help of his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden.

The modern celebration is a family dinner that lasts well into the morning of Jan. 1, accompanied by a multihour televised gala featuring Russian pop stars, glitter, fireworks and an address to the nation from President Vladimir Putin.

On New Year’s Eve, the zakuski course may not end until midnight, when hot dishes are finally served: luxuries like braised short ribs, Georgian chicken tabaka (pan-roasted with lots of garlic and pressed flat, like chicken under a brick), mushrooms and potatoes cooked in lush smetana, the Russian crème fraîche.
