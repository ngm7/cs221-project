ATLANTA — The Oklahoma Sooners (12-1) received the final slot in the four-team College Football Playoff on Sunday over primary contenders Ohio State (12-1) and Georgia (11-2), a move that sidestepped the most controversial possible decision in the playoff’s fifth season.

The other three teams chosen for the playoff are No. 1 Alabama (13-0), No. 2 Clemson (13-0) and No. 3 Notre Dame (12-0).

In the national semifinals, Clemson will play Notre Dame at the Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Tex., on the afternoon of Dec. 29, and Alabama will play Oklahoma at the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla. in the evening. The winners will play for the national championship on Jan. 7 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

Georgia was ranked fifth in the selection committee’s final rankings, while Ohio State was ranked sixth. Due to a separate contract, the Buckeyes will play the Pacific-12 champion, Washington, in the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day.
