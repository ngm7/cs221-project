“She wanted a cigarette,” Ms. Goodson recalled. “I said, ‘You’re in the hospital, you can’t have a cigarette.’ She said, ‘Ma, please.’ So I gave her the cigarette. But I didn’t light it. And she was happy with that.”

Later, she offered her daughter a final reassurance: “I said: ‘Don’t worry, just go to sleep, and I’ll be with you when you wake up.’ And she went to sleep in my arms.”

Knowing how proud her daughter had been that she had gotten clean intensified Ms. Goodson’s desire to make a positive impact on the world. She returned to school with the desire to help others with addiction and mental illness, eventually joining a nonprofit service organization as a counselor.

“When I got sober, I wanted everybody to get sober,” Ms. Goodson said.

Her familiarity with addiction sharpened her ability to spot danger signs. From someone’s eyes or tottering movement, Ms. Goodson could tell if a patient was intoxicated — and having people lie to her was disheartening. Sometimes she would argue vehemently against a patient’s discharge, certain that relapse was imminent, and be proven right weeks later.

The knowledge that she could not protect everybody was demoralizing.

With time, Ms. Goodson has accepted that she is not responsible for everyone; she often recites the Serenity Prayer.
