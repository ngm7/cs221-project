‘POLICE OFFICER’ at Film Forum (Dec. 18, 7:30 p.m.). In Japan, the silent era ended later than it did in the United States, but film noir arrived earlier — at least if one applies that designation to this 1933 feature from Tomu Uchida, which concerns a police officer who grows reacquainted with an old school friend, now a gangster. An imported print will be shown with live piano accompaniment.

RATED X at the Quad Cinema (Dec. 14-Jan. 10). Although the Quad’s survey of the rating that dared not speak its name includes films that became scandalous for being sexually explicit — like Nagisa Oshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses” (on Sunday and on Dec. 23 and Jan. 1) and Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Last Tango in Paris” (on Saturday and Sunday, and on Dec. 28 and Jan. 5) — the lineup is proof that an X rating did not always connote eroticism. Anyone hoping to see skin in the Supreme Court-debated “I Am Curious (Yellow)” (on Friday and on Dec. 24 and Jan. 3), for instance, should be prepared to sit through a lot of dialogue on class struggle. Movies notorious for their violence (“A Clockwork Orange,” on Friday and on Dec. 25 and 30; and “Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,” on Dec. 27 and Jan. 5) share space with camp (“Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,” on Saturday and on Dec. 23 and 31) and experimentation (the Warhol associate Paul Morrissey’s “Women in Revolt,” on Tuesday and Wednesday, and on Dec. 26).

JACQUES TOURNEUR, FEARMAKER at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (Dec. 14-Jan. 3). Particularly in the low-budget movies he made with the producer Val Lewton, Tourneur is famous for making a virtue of the power of suggestion. In “Cat People,” from 1942 (on Friday and on Dec. 22 and 31), starring Simone Simon as a Serbian expatriate with feral tendencies, shadows and screams do more work than any special effect could, particularly in the classic swimming pool scene. The Film Society is billing this as the most complete Tourneur retrospective in decades, with movies from a wide range of genres. Don’t miss the chiller for the ages that is “Night of the Demon” (on Saturday and on Dec. 24 and Jan. 1), in which Dana Andrews is cursed by an eerily well-mannered leader of a satanic cult (Niall MacGinnis).
