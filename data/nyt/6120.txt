“We feel that we can do what we want to do,” he said. “We’ve got roadblocks, which are great defenses on other teams, trying to stop us, but we’ve always said — and no disrespect to other teams — they don’t stop us, we stop ourselves.”

Roethlisberger clearly did not see Jackson coming, but, in the quarterback’s defense, neither did Harbaugh.

Peppered with questions the next day as to whether he would stick with Joe Flacco as his quarterback, Harbaugh, who coached Flacco and the Ravens to a win in Super Bowl XLVII, brushed off the inquiries as ridiculous.

“Joe has played well,” Harbaugh insisted, “So I don’t want to get into all of that. We’re rolling right now with what we got.”

Apparently unknown to Harbaugh at the time was the fact that Flacco was nursing a hip injury. He did not throw another pass for Baltimore this season, sitting at first because of the injury and then because of Jackson’s brilliant play.

Jackson, a 21-year-old who was taken with the 32d overall pick in this year’s draft, took over under center and refashioned the team’s offense into something the N.F.L. had not seen in decades. Over the season’s final seven games, he and running back Gus Edwards, also a rookie, led an offense that generated an incredible 1,607 rushing yards (an average of 229.6 a game), outgaining their opponents in that regard by 1,178 yards, which according to Stats Inc. set a record for the largest margin over seven weeks in the Super Bowl era.

Even Michael Vick was questioning the Ravens’ reliance on quarterback runs, but it worked, leading to a 6-1 record and a division title that seemed unimaginable seven weeks ago.
