The predicament was dire. Otherwise, they never would have called in the women. Fighting in France in World War I, the United States Army was having trouble with the phones. With speed essential in the dispatch of information, calls weren’t getting through fast enough.

Phone calls back then were patched from one operator to the next, so it was a problem if the soldiers at the switchboards couldn’t speak French and communicate with the local operators. Worse, though, was the men’s clumsiness at a critical task that, in the civilian world, was largely women’s work.

Bowing to common sense in the interest of victory, Gen. John Pershing recruited women to the Signal Corps to do the job. At a time when women weren’t even trusted to vote, off they went to Europe, at last with a use for their ladylike fluency in French.

If you’re familiar with this obscure story, the subject of the new musical “The Hello Girls,” you probably also know its ugly epilogue: After the women shipped home, the military spent six decades denying them veterans benefits, insisting that they’d never served. By the time President Jimmy Carter made it right, most of the 223 operators had died.
