“I think the body of work, maybe, is more important than one game,” Happ said. “Or maybe not important, but the body of work is maybe more indicative of the player you are. I certainly don’t mean to downplay the importance of a playoff game.”

He added: “You go back and look at it, and J.D. Martinez hit a pitch that not a lot of guys hit. And he beat me on that pitch, and that’s all I can really say about that. I’m not really here to defend myself. I feel like my work stands for itself.”

The Yankees’ off-season plans have thus far unfolded along the lines that General Manager Brian Cashman laid out at the winter meetings in Las Vegas. He said then that he was loath to make a deal that, if it turned sour, could hamstring the Yankees financially for years.

So, rather than lay out a six-year deal for Patrick Corbin, the Yankees have bolstered their starting rotation by acquiring left-hander James Paxton, who is often injured but is under contract for only two more seasons, and by re-signing Happ. He described the third-year option — which will vest if he makes 27 starts or pitches 165 innings in 2020 — as a bet on himself. He has reached those benchmarks three of the last four years.

With the rotation settled, Cashman is now turning his attention to the bullpen, which has lost Zach Britton and David Robertson to free agency, and to finding a middle infield replacement for shortstop Didi Gregorius, who is expected to miss three to five months after undergoing Tommy John surgery.
