Money can’t buy you everything, but in 18th-century Rome, it could underwrite some pretty amazing acquisitions: a shoebox-size, neo-Classical, gilt silver casket for your wine; a Rococo clock consisting almost entirely of vivacious curves (not a straight line anywhere); or an exquisite bronze miniature of a famous Greek sculpture like the Apollo Belvedere, just the thing for a royal study.

On a more ambitious scale, surplus income might procure a complete gilt silver service for Mass in a private chapel or a large and astounding centerpiece called a deser, fit for banquets and made of small copies of temples from the Roman Forum in assorted marbles, semiprecious stones and antique cameos — each more gorgeous than the next. In all cases, the gilding of silver or bronze is done with gold, which creates a thin-skinned but luxurious radiance.

These ostentatious items would all have come from the bustling workshop of Luigi Valadier (1726-1785), among the most sought-after of Roman silversmiths who was, as well, an outstanding draftsman, designer, goldsmith and sculptor in bronze. And “you,” to be clear, would have been a member of a princely Italian family — a Borghese, Chigi or Orsini — an emissary of the King of Sweden, Madame du Barry or perhaps the Roman Catholic Church, in need of half-size gilt bronze and silver saints for the High Altar of the Cathedral of Monreale in Sicily.
