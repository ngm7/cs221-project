“The Monk family requested that they would like to use the name in other directions, and we decided that we would abide by their wishes,” Thomas R. Carter, the institute’s president, said in an interview. “All the programs that are currently in place will continue.”

The drummer T.S. Monk, the son of the institute’s famed namesake, did not respond to an email requesting comment. He has been a ubiquitous presence at Monk competitions, but did not attend this year’s event.

The Monk institute started the competition in 1987, and for its first three years it focused on rising pianists. Starting in 1990, it began to highlight a different instrument each year; it has since helped to catapult the careers of prominent young vocalists, saxophonists, trumpeters, drummers and more.

The institute had not held a gala since 2015. Mr. Carter attributed this to the institute’s recent focus on International Jazz Day, an initiative it began in 2011, and the difficulty of arts fund-raising at a time when natural disasters have put an added burden on humanitarian philanthropy.

Mr. Oren, a native of Tel Aviv, is very much a product of jazz’s educational establishment. He attended the Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts in Givatayim, Israel, and the Israel Conservatory of Music in Tel Aviv, as well as the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in Ramat HaSharon and the Arison Campus of the Arts in Tel Aviv. He came to the United States in 2012 to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston on a four-year scholarship.
