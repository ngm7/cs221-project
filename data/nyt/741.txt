When Christine Girard was presented with the gold medal in weight lifting from the 2012 Olympics, there was a podium, a Canadian flag and an anthem sung by a choir. In the audience were Olympians, officials, friends and family.

Included among them were her three children, none of them yet born in 2012. Thatâ€™s because the presentation of the medal came on Monday, more than six years after the competition.

In London, Girard lifted a total of 520 pounds, good for third place in her division. It was the first medal ever for a female Canadian weight lifter. But in 2016, Maiya Maneza of Kazakhstan and Svetlana Tsarukayeva of Russia were disqualified after retesting of their samples revealed performance-enhancing drugs. Girard became the retroactive gold medalist.

At the National Arts Center in Ottawa, about 100 people gathered for a 20-minute ceremony during which Girard finally got her gold medal.
