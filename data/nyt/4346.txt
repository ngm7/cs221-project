AGGRETSUKO: WE WISH YOU A METAL CHRISTMAS on Netflix. “Aggretsuko” is an anime series about Retsuko, a red panda with a frustrating desk job who unwinds through death metal. In this Christmas special, Retsuko develops a social-media addiction — which should give her plenty more to vent about. The episode also features a punk-rock version of “Jingle Bells,” performed by Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL GOES WRONG on BroadwayHD. Those looking for a riff on Charles Dickens’s holiday classic have no shortage of options.

SCHINDLER’S LIST (1993) on Netflix. In a recent interview with The Times, the director Steven Spielberg was asked what he would change if he were to make “Schindler’s List” today. “There’s nothing I would have changed, absolutely nothing,” he said. “I stand by the film as it has stood its own test of time.” This Holocaust epic starring Liam Neeson is now a quarter-century old; you can stream it if you missed its recent 25th anniversary theatrical run.
