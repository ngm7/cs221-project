My countdown of 2018’s most important stories takes a Christmas break today and will resume tomorrow. In the meantime, it’s time for two recommendations that are becoming an annual tradition in this newsletter:

However you’re spending the day, I suggest making a little time for Duke Ellington. His 1960 reimagining of Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite, which Ellington arranged with Billy Strayhorn, is the album I play most often this time of year. It’s a classically American cultural melting pot and — as Nick Spitzer, the host of the radio program “American Routes,” says — “just a lot of fun.”

I pointed toward this YouTube version, by the Sacramento Jazz Orchestra and ARC Studio Jazz Ensemble, last year, and it’s lovely. But if you have a subscription service like Spotify, you can also find it there. The user wasmax2000 has created a convenient playlist with the full piece. Put it on in the background as you have breakfast, open presents or spend time with family.
