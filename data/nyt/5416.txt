SHANGHAI â€” Eight people were killed and more than 20 injured on Tuesday when a man with a knife hijacked a bus and drove it into traffic in a southeastern Chinese city, according to state media reports.

The attack happened around 3 p.m. in the city of Longyan in Fujian Province. The Beijing News, a government-run paper, quoted a witness who said the bus had run into three motor scooters, a taxi and a car.

On Chinese social media, several graphic videos of the aftermath showed bodies splayed across the street amid auto wreckage, some of which was pinned beneath the bus.
