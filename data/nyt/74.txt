WASHINGTON — An independent government agency, facing criticism over a warning to federal employees against taking positions for or against the impeachment of President Trump and using slogans incorporating the word “resist,” revised its guidance on Friday to say that some discussion of both topics remained lawful.

The agency, the Office of Special Counsel, enforces the Hatch Act, a law that bars federal employees from engaging in political activity for or against partisan election campaigns while at work or in their official capacity. (It is not related to the special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.)

The agency had issued its initial guidance earlier this week about discussion of impeachment and “resistance” to more than two million federal employees. It said that because Mr. Trump was already running for re-election, such statements were effectively advocating support or opposition to his candidacy and were therefore illegal under the Hatch Act.

Some legal specialists said the agency’s guidance went too far. On Friday, the agency issued what it characterized as an extension and clarification, which stressed that casual discussion of impeachment remained acceptable.
