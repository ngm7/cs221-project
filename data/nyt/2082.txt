Mr. Guzzone had a particularly close relationship with the owners of Litespeed Electric, a contractor based in New Jersey, who are also scheduled to surrender to the authorities on Tuesday.

Mark Agnifilo, a lawyer for Robert Fleming at Litespeed, said there was no evidence that Mr. Fleming paid “cash kickbacks” to Mr. Guzzone or anyone else, or that Bloomberg paid more than it should have for electrical services. Mr. Agnifilo said that many of the things that Mr. Fleming was being accused of are common practices in the industry.

“The New York City construction industry is obviously highly competitive,” Mr. Agnifilo said. “Honest companies go to great lengths to keep getting lucrative contracts. I don’t think Litespeed is any different.”

Investigators also seized records at Turner Construction offices downtown. The company has insisted that two of its top executives in the interior construction division — Ronald Olson and Vito Negro — had gone “rogue,” deliberately evading the company’s internal compliance program. Those men were fired by Turner in October 2017.

Tom Curran, a lawyer for Turner Construction, said his company and Bloomberg aided the district attorney’s investigation from the start. Neither company is being charged with anything or fined, he said.

For months, the close-knit industry has been rife with rumors about a pending indictment involving as many as 40 executives and millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. In recent months, more than 14 people have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with investigators.

Corruption scandals in the interior construction industry, a specialized subset of construction work, occur periodically The highly profitable work covers the guts of a building, everything from dry wall, electrical and plumbing to lighting and carpeting.
