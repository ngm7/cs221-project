National reaction: The funeral offers an opportunity for a divided country to pause and reflect, our chief Washington correspondent writes.

Voices: Mr. Bush has been lying in state at the Capitol Rotunda, and we spoke to some of those who went to pay their respects. “All decisions he made may not have been favored by all Americans,” one said, “but it was in the best interest of the country.”

Closer look: Mr. Bush and his son George W. Bush, who will deliver the main eulogy today, shared an unbreakable bond despite a lifetime of tensions.

The details: Mr. Trump has designated today a national day of mourning. The stock markets will be closed, and the Postal Service won’t make regular deliveries.
