As part of a major shake-up at Penguin Random House, which recently merged two of its biggest publishing divisions — Crown Publishing Group and Random House — Molly Stern, Crown’s senior vice president and publisher, will be leaving the company.

Ms. Stern’s departure came on the heels of one of her greatest publishing successes: She was the editor for Michelle Obama’s memoir “Becoming,” which sold more than two million copies in just 15 days after its initial release, making it the best-selling book of 2018. In her acknowledgments, Mrs. Obama wrote that Ms. Stern’s “enthusiasm, energy, and passion instantly drew me to her. Molly kept me buoyed by her unwavering faith in my vision for this book.”

Ms. Stern is widely regarded within the publishing world for having an eye for both best-selling commercial fiction and award-winning literary fiction and nonfiction. Under her direction at Crown, the company published blockbusters like Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl,” Andy Weir’s “The Martian” and Ernest Cline’s “Ready Player One,” as well as acclaimed nonfiction by best-selling authors such as Susan Cain, Erik Larson and Matthew Desmond, who won the Pulitzer Prize for “Evicted.” Ms. Stern, who realized the book-selling power of social media very early, asked Sarah Jessica Parker to start an imprint at Hogarth, which is part of Crown.

Following the announced exit of Maya Mavjee, Crown’s president and publisher, who will leave the company at the end of the year, Ms. Stern is the most prominent executive to leave as a result of the reorganization.
