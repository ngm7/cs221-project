Good morning. Our Tejal Rao is in The New York Times Magazine this weekend with a column about cooking freestyle rice porridge— not congee, not jook — with the Los Angeles chef Minh Phan. To accompany her words, Tejal brought us Phan’s delightful recipe for rice porridge with squash and brown butter (above). That’s your dinner for Monday night, though you should make it this afternoon. The day’s rest gives the rice time to settle with the other ingredients and become rich with flavor.

“People say, ‘Oh, it’s Vietnamese food,’ but it’s not,” Phan told Tejal, about the porridge she learned to cook from her mom, who has roots in northern Vietnam. “Honestly, my mom gets offended if you call it Vietnamese food, so please don’t offend my mom!”

And for dinner tonight? Stay with squash, unless you’d prefer to explore our recipes for the Hanukkah holiday that gets underway at sundown. I like the idea of Melissa Clark’s new recipe for acorn squash “stuffed” with Gruyère fondue, perhaps alongside these chicken cutlets with mushroom dressing. Or perhaps all on its own, with a watercress salad. Or maybe with the latkes of our old colleague David Firestone, “the Latke King.” Happy Hanukkah!

Your Monday’s accounted for already, with the porridge. Heat and serve!

Tuesday, maybe you can make Alison Roman’s recipe for salmon with sesame and herbs, perhaps with rice and absolutely with a few handfuls of extra arugula, to build up the herb salad.
