Doug Williams, the former player and current Redskins executive, was roundly criticized when he described Foster’s arrest as “small potatoes” in a radio interview. He later apologized.

Experts who have advised the league said teams were foremost focused on winning, and the league and teams preferred to handle situations that might require discipline internally, keeping matters under wraps as long as possible. If the bad behavior is exposed, teams adopt a crisis response approach to clean it up.

“They hold everything close to the chest,” said Rene Redwood, who has advised the league on issues of race and abuse. “When it becomes a consistent problem, and holding the information doesn’t seem to remedy it, they try to get through it with another public relations activity.”

The league in recent years has sought to project intolerance for off-field misconduct. In 2014, after several star players — including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy — were suspended after they had been charged with physical abuse or domestic violence, the N.F.L. beefed up its investigation unit and said it would no longer rely solely on the police or whether charges had been filed when assessing possible misconduct.

Yet self-reflection and scrutiny have never been this league’s strong suit — it’s a multibillion-dollar business trying to survive and thrive amid questions about head injuries and the changing dynamics of television — and some players are penalized only a few games, if at all, for their misconduct. They often get signed by teams that cross their fingers and hope the players behave.

“It sends a troubling message because there’s a lack of consistency,” said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law and ethics at Fordham University. These episodes are “a validation of the continued problem the league has with this issue, that individual teams will prioritize their need for certain players despite questionable behavior off the field.”
