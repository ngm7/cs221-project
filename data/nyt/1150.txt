Sometimes the city works.

There was a plan, which provoked protests. The Landmarks Commission, with unusual readiness, swooped in. The new plan is better.

The tale argues for the whole messy, infuriating way New York occasionally stumbles toward progress.

Tuesday night, in a Manhattan high school library, before a subcommittee of Community Board 5 and a small audience, the architects and developers of what used to be called the AT&T building — freshly minted as an official city landmark — presented their revised proposal to turn a historic, now vacant skyscraper into a Class A 21st-century office tower.

This time the idea no longer involves stripping away the base of the building’s pink granite facade, the proposal that incited the Landmarks Commission earlier in the year. This time, less is more. And credit to those who stood up for saving an architectural lightning rod.
