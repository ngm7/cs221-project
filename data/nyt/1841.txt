But the proposal left many parties unhappy. Union officials worried that provisions to streamline development approvals would affect workers. Anti-gentrification advocates worried the bill would lead to the displacement of people living in existing neighborhoods. City leaders didn’t want to give up the ability to shape their communities. The bill eventually died a high-profile death.

Which brings us about up-to-date. Mr. Wiener brought the bill back last week — but with some changes.

I asked Conor, who covers housing from the Times’s San Francisco bureau, about what could be next. The conversation is edited and condensed.

Jill Cowan: The big question is, does the bill have a shot at passing this time?

Conor Dougherty: I don’t know. Does it have a better shot of passing? Probably, because Wiener has gotten construction unions on board, and he has addressed some of the concerns about gentrification.

When S.B. 827 failed, it was opposed by the mayor of Beverly Hills, the Sierra Club and anti-gentrification advocates.

Can he split that kind of coalition? Getting the unions on board helps, but it’s still very early and there will be plenty of powerful opponents.
