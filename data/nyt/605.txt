Hello! Welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture.

I have been really enjoying HBO’s adaptation of “My Brilliant Friend,” which has been airing on Sunday and Monday nights. This week’s episodes were intense as teenage angst gave way to very adult concerns (Times staffers discussed them here). And now HBO has signed on to air the next eight episodes, produced by an Italian company, that will cover the second book in Elena Ferrante’s series, “The Story of a New Name.” I can’t wait.

1. Kanye on Broadway

Last night at the premiere of “The Cher Show,” Kanye West became the latest theater audience member to be told off for using a phone during a Broadway performance. (He apologized.)
