With its promise of new beginnings, fresh starts, all that, New Year’s Eve is supposed to feel auspicious and meaningful. We bind our desires to a square on the calendar, even though we understand how arbitrary that is, even though we know better. Healthy or sick, wealthy or poor, wedded or widowed — we are expected to get out there and revel, even when the last thing many of us want is to mark that time is passing so obviously and so ruthlessly. And no matter how low key my approach to the holiday had become, there seemed to be no way to subvert it altogether.

Then, a couple of years ago, work required me to be in England in early January. As I looked at flights from New York to London, I noticed that if I left two days sooner than I’d intended, the price dropped substantially. That, I assumed, was because flying two days earlier would mean flying on New Year’s Eve.

“Who flies on New Year’s Eve?” an automatic impulse made me ask myself, with an implicit “when they should be out celebrating” trailing close behind. But as soon as I shook off the dandruff of cultural conditioning, I knew exactly what sort of person would fly — and alone, no less — on New Year’s Eve: me. That’s who.

I embraced the scheme, as though, like some kind of strategic mastermind, I’d planned it that way all along. Flying on New Year’s Eve provided a ready excuse to turn down invitations (or to feel fine if I didn’t get any). I also didn’t mind saving a couple of hundred bucks. Plus, I’d heard a rumor that the airlines serve Champagne, gratis, to their New Year’s Eve guests.

Although I can’t presume to understand what dwelled in the hearts and minds of my fellow passengers, they struck me as kindred spirits: No one showed any sign of caring that it was New Year’s Eve. I saw not one sparkly hat. Zero noisemakers. Not a single fleck of confetti. We were quietly united in our not-celebration. I really liked those people.
