WASHINGTON — Foreshadowing a likely partisan battle next year, Robert L. Wilkie, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, faced sharp questioning from Democrats on Wednesday over how the department will carry out a new expansion of private-sector medical care for veterans.

Lawmakers attending a joint House-Senate hearing scrutinized evolving standards at the V.A. that dictate how and when veterans can get care outside of the system’s 1,300 government hospitals and clinics. The Trump administration is expected to better define the standards next year, but some at the hearing were not satisfied.

Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate veterans committee, complained that Congress had been “left trying to figure out why the V.A. is taking things in a different direction than what Congress intended.”

The criticism was notable since Mr. Wilkie has largely faced a friendly audience from both Republicans and Democrats since taking the helm of the department in July.
