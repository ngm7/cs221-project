Plan less

This is another seemingly counterintuitive tip, but if you plan less you’ll be less stressed. Sure, having a per-second itinerary may seem like a gift for your future vacation self, but once there you’re going to feel rushed and anxious about making your next stop.

Sure, keep a list of things you want to do, but allow for lots of flexibility. You’re not going to see everything, so enjoy what you can and don’t rush. Less planning allows you to stay longer in spots you like, and leave early from places you don’t.

Slow down

This is a hard one. It may come across preachy and I’m sorry, but cramming 15 cities into 14 days is going to make you miserable. I try to spend at least three days in each place. That gives you enough time to get the feel and decide if you want to stay, or go somewhere else. Everyone has their own best pace, but if you’re changing accommodations every other day, you’re going to be exhausted.

Keep your phone working

Turn off your work email and notifications, but keep your internet access. Google Maps, Google Translate, travel booking sites, plus messenger apps to keep in touch with people at home will all be at your fingertips.
