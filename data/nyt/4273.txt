Jarrett Allen is not scared of anyone on the basketball court. Not even LeBron James.

On Tuesday, as the Nets hosted the red-hot Los Angeles Lakers, Allen proved it when James, a 6-foot-8, 270-pound bulldozer of a human being, drove into the lane and elevated toward the basket, just as he has done nearly 2,000 times in his 16-year career.

Allen, a few inches taller than James but about 30 pounds lighter, did not give way. He shifted into position, reached up with his right hand and got clean contact on the ball, sending it off the backboard as he crashed to the floor after the collision.
