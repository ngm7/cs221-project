Re “Trump Charity Agrees to End Amid Lawsuit” (front page, Dec. 19): Once again a Trump entity has been accused of acting illegally and has been forced to shut down. This time, at least several hundred thousand dollars from the Trump Foundation, a “charity,” was reportedly diverted to private uses such as paying for a portrait of the president, political activities and the renovation of a fountain outside a Trump hotel.

Previously, President Trump was forced to return $25 million to students of his shuttered Trump University, a portion of what they say they were defrauded of.

When people can go to jail for stealing a pack of gum, why are there these settlements without incarceration for crimes that are substantially more serious?
