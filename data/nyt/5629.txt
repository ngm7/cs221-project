SKOPJE, Macedonia — As he awaited a ruling on his appeal against a corruption conviction, Nikola Gruevski, the former Macedonian prime minister, gave the impression that he was resigned to going to prison.

It was early November, and Mr. Gruevski contacted the prisons authority about conditions inside jail. He asked his bodyguards, allocated to him by the state, to buy him clothes to wear while incarcerated. He strolled around central Skopje as if savoring his last days as a free man.

But on the day he was finally told to report to jail, Mr. Gruevski vanished. He re-emerged four days later — but in Hungary, where he was soon granted political asylum by the far-right government of his political ally, Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

“It was like out of a movie,” said Vessela Tcherneva, deputy director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research group.
