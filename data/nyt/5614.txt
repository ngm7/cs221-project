Re "Stress, Exhaustion and Guilt: Modern Parenting" (The Upshot, front page, Dec. 25) :

Listening to parents who helicopter and those who free-range, one can hear a key difference that is often missed, often denied by the parents: goals. Helicopter parents focus on their children’s success in societal terms, on beating the Joneses; free-rangers want their children to be strong, self-determined, at peace, what we used to call self-actualized, even if later on they don’t make a lot of money or win awards.

Although these goals shouldn’t be mutually exclusive they are often wildly so in the real world, as shown by the research your article mentions. How about a little balance, a little appreciation and carrying out of both goals — combined, of course, with attention to what suits the child, who, research shows, does come out of the womb with strengths, weaknesses, interests and proclivities.

To the Editor:

Your article about how much time parents think that they must spend schlepping, coaching, reading to, playing with and supervising their children is a great summation of why both generations are so anxious these days.

Parents are stalked by the twin fears that their children will be unsafe — or not get into Harvard. That’s obviously anxiety-producing. As a result, their children have no unsupervised time — and that is anxiety-producing, too. When all your time is directed by others, you have no evidence that you can handle challenges or make things happen, and you feel unprepared for a world you’ve been told is filled with pitfalls and danger.
