$12 MILLION

26 Vandam Street (between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street)

Manhattan

A private investor has bought this five-story, 12,349-square-foot apartment building in the Hudson Square neighborhood. There are 19 apartments: nine two-bedrooms, eight one-bedrooms, one four-bedroom and one five-bedroom. Five are rent stabilized, two are rent controlled, and a dozen are renovated market-rate apartments with new hardwood floors, open-space kitchens and exposed brick walls. The cap rate is 4.33 percent. The building has no air rights since the previous owner, Stellar Management, which bought the building for $6.1 million at the end of 2012, applied them toward the addition of a penthouse to its One SoHo Square office project, which combined 161 Avenue of the Americas and 233 Spring Street.
