“A mother’s dead body is not to be seen,” the writer Scholastique Mukasonga’s mother, Stefania, would tell her girls. “You’ll have to cover me, my daughters, that’s your job and no one else’s.”

But no one covered her. There were no daughters left. Stefania’s girls — all except Scholastique, who had fled to France — were among 37 family members massacred in the Rwandan genocide in the spring of 1994, when the Hutu majority turned on their Tutsi neighbors, killing more than 800,000 people in 100 days. Elementary school teachers attacked their students. Priests hacked their parishioners to death. The bones of Mukasonga’s family lay scattered and anonymous, in ossuaries or simply where they had fallen.

Mukasonga and one brother survived, saved by their mother’s ingenuity. She had them smuggled into Burundi, then Senegal, when they were teenagers, many years before the genocide began. The siblings made a pact; one would study while the other worked to support them, then they’d keep switching, back and forth. Mukasonga later became a social worker and settled in France; her brother became a doctor.

In “The Barefoot Woman,” Mukasonga’s latest book, translated from the French into English by Jordan Stump, she attempts to fulfill her daughterly duty: “Mama, I wasn’t there to cover your body, and all I have left is words — words in a language you didn’t understand — to do as you asked. And I’m all alone with my feeble words, and on the pages of my notebook, over and over, my sentences weave a shroud for your missing body.”
