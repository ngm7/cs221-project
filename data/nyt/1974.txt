What’s on TV

MY BRILLIANT FRIEND 9 p.m. on HBO; also streaming on HBO platforms. HBO’s intimate adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s first Neapolitan novel closes out its first season, which the critic James Poniewozik of The New York Times designated a Critic’s Pick. Directed by the Italian filmmaker Saverio Costanzo, the show largely focuses on the best friends Lenù (Margherita Mazzucco) and Lila (Gaia Girace) as they stumble through a tumultuous adolescence in a poor and violent neighborhood in post-World War II Naples. The finale, like most of the season, finds the girls trying to harness power in situations that leave them largely powerless to the forces (or men) around them: Lenù is kicked out of her high school class for voicing her opinion, and Lila butts heads with her suitor, Stefano, on decisions regarding her family’s shoe business.

CMA COUNTRY CHRISTMAS 8 p.m. on ABC. Reba McEntire returns for a second year to host this holiday music special. The two-hour event features performances by Amy Grant, Martina McBride, Brad Paisley and more, as well as a special duet by Tony Bennett and Diana Krall.
