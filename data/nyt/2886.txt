Give one group of New York officials a pat on the back, and another inevitably slaps you in the face.

It was good news that a special pay committee recommended that state legislators not only get a substantial raise to recognize that their positions are full-time jobs but also that there be strict limitations on their outside income and bureaucratic perks.

Now legislative leaders may be scheming to get one without the other. (Guess which one they want.)

Under legislation that set up the committee this year, its recommendation of a $50,500 raise to their $79,500 salary, limits on outside income to 15 percent of base pay, and limits on stipends for the heads of legislative committees will become law on Jan. 1 unless the Legislature formally rejects it.

Silly us for thinking they wouldnâ€™t do that and, even though many legislators objected to restrictions on outside income, this important block on corruption would finally become law.
