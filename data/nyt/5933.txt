A difficult season for Aaron Rodgers — from start to finish — ended prematurely on Sunday when the Green Bay Packers quarterback departed during the first half of a loss to the Detroit Lions with a concussion.

The Packers were losing with Rodgers, and they continued to lose with DeShone Kizer filling in for him, eventually finishing with a humiliating 31-0 loss at home to a division rival.

The season began with Rodgers sustaining a severe knee injury in a comeback victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 1. He proved capable of playing through the injury as the season rolled on, but the Packers quickly fell apart anyway. The team fired its head coach — Mike McCarthy, who had been with the team since 2006 — midseason for the first time in franchise history. The change at the top provided no spark, though, as a Week 15 loss to the Chicago Bears ensured that the Packers would have a losing record in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1990 and 1991.

On Sunday, in a game with no consequences for either team, Rodgers had completed 3 of 5 passes for 26 yards when he walked off the field to be evaluated for a concussion. He had sustained a hit earlier that jarred his helmet loose but stayed in the game, so it was unclear exactly when the injury occurred.
