Andrei Bitov, a Russian writer whose work, whether elaborate travelogue or intricate novel, was full of insights into his country’s history and literature, died on Monday in Moscow. He was 81.

The Russian chapter of the writers’ group PEN International, which he helped found, announced his death on its website. Mikhail Epstein, Mr. Bitov’s friend and the Samuel Candler Dobbs professor of cultural theory and Russian literature at Emory University, said the cause was heart disease.

“Bitov is justly considered a founder of Russian postmodernism, a vast and still influential movement,” Professor Epstein said by email, “especially in his masterpiece novel ‘Pushkin House,’ which explores the complex relationship between the author and his hero.

“Bitov,” he added, “introduced into Russian literature the most subtle nuances of self-reflective existence, and the multiplicity of narrative frames and points of view. In this respect he can be compared only with Vladimir Nabokov.”
