‘Wrestlers are said to “keep kayfabe” if they refuse to acknowledge wrestling’s artifice.’

— From “The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling: A Hardcore, High-Flying, No-Holds-Barred History of the One True Sport” (Ten Speed Press, 2018, Page 33), by Aubrey Sitterson and Chris Moreno.

The wrestling term “kayfabe” has a perfect origin story: Nobody knows exactly where it came from. It is almost, but not quite, pig Latin for “fake.” It looks more like the word “fake” caught in a suplex, picked up and twisted around, then slammed down into a new shape with a dislocated meaning.

This, in fact, is not a bad description. To “keep kayfabe” is to insist — heroically or foolishly, angelically or devilishly — that what is happening in professional wrestling is actually real.

This is despite the fact that everyone knows pro wrestling is less a sport than a whirling vortex of truth and lies, complete with soap-opera twists and scripted results. “There is no more a problem of truth in wrestling than in the theater,” Roland Barthes wrote way back in 1952. And yet these theatrical scripts are performed by skilled athletes with superhero musculature, and the altercations are so dangerous that wrestlers sometimes — in very nonfake ways — die or get paralyzed or suffer debilitating brain damage.
