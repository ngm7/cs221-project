Previews and Openings

‘BLUE RIDGE’ at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (previews start on Dec. 12; opens on Jan. 7). Classroom management is one thing. Anger management is another. In this comedy by Abby Rosebrock (“Dido of Idaho”), directed by Taibi Magar, a high school teacher with rage issues lands at an Appalachian halfway house. The production stars Marin Ireland, an actress who specializes — thrillingly — in difficult women.
