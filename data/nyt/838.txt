“The Charmer” is a Danish thriller about an Iranian named Esmail. Played by Ardalan Esmaili, he’s handsome in a youthful, gentle, intelligent way. We see him in bed and on dates with women. But you need only a few scenes to understand that nothing about the sex and seduction corresponds to regular dating. Esmail is desperate — an immigrant, not a tourist. And the movie, in nail-biting, onion-peeling style, explains what he’s desperate for. To stay in Denmark, he needs one of these connections to turn into a relationship with a woman willing to say that he’s hers.

But he might have been at this for long enough, though — frequenting the same wine bar in a Copenhagen neighborhood far from and nicer than where he lives — that you can smell more than cologne. He’s grown a little skunky.

One unhappy-looking woman says he’s going way too fast. Another goes to a more dire extreme. And one evening, at that bar, a different young woman snidely, yet somehow flirtatiously, tells him what she smells — in Persian. Her name is Sara (Soho Rezanejad), and she’s Iranian, too. Esmail has zeroed in on her friend, and she’s not going to let him use her. But “The Charmer” is a movie full of surprises, and one of the happy ones is the closeness that develops between Sara and Esmail. You don’t see it coming, and neither does he. She asks him to parties and introduces him to her mother and their vibrant Danish Iranian community.
