“People look terrified,” Ms. Hodges said, viewing her, as she described, like a “child bride.”

Kevin Phinney, 26, meanwhile, bore the baby-faced burden in another arena: dating apps. A girl he matched with asked if the pictures on his profile were taken recently, because, as she delicately put it, “You look like a child.” Mr. Phinney changed up his pictures soon after.

All of these scenarios might seem benign, but experienced repeatedly over several years, they can affect a person’s self-perception. If something is consistently shoved in your (baby) face through different corners of society, no matter what it is, you start to believe it.

When Ana Travis, a 31-year-old high school teacher, started her career, some of her students’ parents thought she was 18 — no matter that she wore makeup and purposefully dressed to look older. During her first couple of years at her high school, even staff members would ask “Where’s your pass?” as she walked the hallways.

“When I get a little bit older,” Ms. Travis said of her young appearance, “I’ll probably appreciate it more.”

Dave Lohse wholeheartedly agrees. He thinks us baby facers should celebrate. Here’s the catch, though: Mr. Lohse is 63 and often guessed to be in his 50s. Looking young is, as he put it, “a wonderful thing.” He is living proof of the remark young-looking people everywhere hear daily: “You’ll love it when you’re older.”

So we’re left with an important question: What are supposed to do now? What are we supposed to do when a co-worker mistakes us for an intern or shames us for wearing a tie into the office to appear older? When a client asks where our boss is? When our IDs are scrutinized and ages debated?

What are we supposed to do until it pays off in 20 years?

My only answer: Don’t shave your beard.
