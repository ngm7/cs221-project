This week on the Billboard chart, 6ix9ine, the Brooklyn rapper currently jailed on federal gang charges, narrowly missed landing a No. 1 album from prison, despite only three days of chart eligibility. Instead, in a shrewd business move, the rapper Travis Scott used T-shirts, key chains and beach towels — each of which happened to come with a copy of his album — to return to the top, while simultaneously earning a No. 1 Billboard single.

Scott’s album “Astroworld” (Cactus Jack/Epic), which was released in August, jumps back to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 thanks to a so-called merchandise bundle, a chart trick in which an album is packaged with other goods and counts as a sale if the buyer redeems the music.

The rapper used the e-commerce holiday known as Cyber Monday to release a new round of products to his loyal, fashion-loving fans, helping to carry him to a total of 31,000 albums sold, according to Nielsen Music. When added to the album’s 52 million streams and 27,000 song downloads for the week, “Astroworld” had more than enough activity — 71,000 album equivalent units, by the industry’s math — to spend its third overall week at No. 1. (Scott used similar merchandise bundles around the album’s debut, much to the consternation of Nicki Minaj, who settled for No. 2 over the summer.)

At the same time, Scott’s single “Sicko Mode,” which features the chart hero Drake in an uncredited appearance, ascends to No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart, the Hot 100, aided by a new remix by Skrillex. (For Billboard, plays of the remix count toward the original’s total numbers.) The song dethrones Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next,” which may very well return to the top next week after the blockbuster release of its teen-movie music video, which broke the 24-hour YouTube record for views.
