WASHINGTON — As the third government shutdown of the Trump era dragged into Christmas, lawmakers from both parties said on Monday that the partial lapse in government funding was in large part the consequence of Congress’s ceding of power to the executive branch, a longstanding trend that may have peaked in the Trump era.

On Christmas Eve, Mr. Trump kept up his efforts to put his own spin on the shutdown, again floating the prospect of going around Congress to find funding for his promised wall on the southwestern border. Lawmakers had abandoned the Capitol and given up negotiating an end to the impasse until later this week.

It was not clear whether that was a path toward signing legislation to reopen the government without additional wall money or a new provocation.

“The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand,” wrote Mr. Trump, who later lamented that he had been left alone at the White House, away from his Florida estate and forced to confront opposition to his demands for wall funding.
