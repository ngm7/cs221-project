It was a difficult decision to leave the Smithsonian, he said, but the association “is an organization that looks those issues squarely in the face.” His last day will be June 15, 2019; he said he would use the next six months to help with the transition to a new leader.

Dr. Skorton, who previously served on the board of the association of medical colleges, succeeded G. Wayne Clough, another former university president, who led the Smithsonian for seven years.

During Dr. Skorton’s four-year tenure, he oversaw important milestones, including the opening of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall which opened in 2016, and the completion of a $1.88 billion capital campaign. He also was in charge of the Smithsonian’s strategic plan, which includes ambitions to reach a greater audience. He said he was proud of the Smithsonian’s collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, a project that will give the Smithsonian its first permanent gallery abroad.

He said he had also made progress on diversity, including initiating the women’s history initiative, “Because of Her Story,” to tell a more complete account of women’s achievements in the United States. He said he calculated that, during his term, 70 percent of new hires at director level had been women or people of color, including the first female director of the National Air and Space Museum and the first woman to be named director of the Museum of American History, an appointment announced this month.

David Rubenstein, chairman of the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, said that the news that Dr. Skorton would be departing had been unexpected but that the board understood his passion for health care.
