A note to readers: On Politics will take a break next week and return in the new year. We hope you have a happy holiday.

The government shutdown began.

How did we get here?

On Tuesday, the White House signaled that President Trump might back down on his demand for $5 billion for a wall at the southern border as part of a spending deal that would head off a partial government shutdown.

On Wednesday night, after a contentious day of negotiating, the Senate passed a stopgap bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8. The bill did not include money for the border wall.
