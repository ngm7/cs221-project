What’s on TV

LEGENDS OF THE LOST WITH MEGAN FOX 8 p.m. on Travel Channel. In her new TV show, the star of “Transformers” and “Jennifer’s Body” travels the world in what the network calls an attempt to “uncover answers about the age-old mysteries that still perplex scientists and archaeologists to this day.” The four-part series, which seems to fall somewhere between “Tomb Raider” and the History Channel’s “Ancient Aliens,” follows Fox, a self-described “seeker,” as she treks from Stonehenge to Scandinavia to Turkey. On the premiere, she looks into findings that suggest female warriors fought with the Vikings.

THE PROFIT 10 p.m. on CNBC. Marcus Lemonis starts the sixth season of his business-reality TV series, which focuses on helping struggling small businesses around the country. In the premiere, he heads to NYC Bagel Deli in Chicago to offer input on the company’s branding, though the owner seems hesitant to change. The episode follows a special behind-the-scenes look at Lemonis’s trip to A. Stein Meats in Brooklyn, which shows at 9 p.m.
