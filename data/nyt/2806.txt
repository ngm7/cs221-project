The Basics

For a 92-year-old hotel, the Hotel Figueroa is very “on trend,” as marketers like to say. It was built by the Y.W.C.A. as an exclusively female hostelry — a spot where single women, including aspiring actresses, could stay without fear of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. The Figueroa supposedly even gave the United States its first female hotel manager: Maude Bouldin, a motorcyle-riding tour de force. Facing mounting debt a few years after opening, the 14-story property had to abandon its single-sex focus. Then the long decline of downtown Los Angeles took a toll. By 2014, when new owners began a $60 million luxury revamp, the hotel had a Morocco-by-way-of-Sweden theme (don’t ask) and was catering to discount German tour groups. The renovation, which was completed earlier this year, leans into the Figueroa’s feminist history, with artwork from local female artists on the walls and common spaces designed to host women-centric “salons.”

Location

The Fig, as locals know it, sits across the street from L.A. Live, a teeming complex where the masses feed at chain restaurants before heading to the adjacent Staples Center and Microsoft Theater. The Grammy Museum is also located there. Downtown stretches in the opposite direction, offering the gentrified foodie temple Grand Central Market and the restored Theater at Ace Hotel, which hosts indie bands and screens art films. The cavernous Flower Market to the south is eye-popping and only charges $1 admission on Saturdays. Parking around the Figueroa is plentiful; we skipped the hotel’s overnight option ($49.50 with tax) and paid a flat $22 at a lot a few feet away.
