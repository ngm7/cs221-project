Diggy Simmons, 23, the son of Rev Run of Run DMC, has stepped out of his father’s shadow. His second studio album, “Lighten Up,” was released last month. And he has a supporting role on the ABC sitcom “grown-ish” (the spinoff of “black-ish”), which begins its second season in January. In addition to dividing his energy between music and acting, he splits his time between New York and Los Angeles. Here’s how he keeps it all together.

Lemon Cleanse

I love to start the morning with room temperature water with lemon. That’s my thing. The rest of the morning depends on what my schedule calls for. If I have an early, early call, like 5 a.m., I’m doing the call first and heading straight to set. From there, I figure out how I can get to the gym and fit in a workout.

Muscle Confusion

I’m getting a workout in, usually six days a week. I’m constantly adjusting my workout. Right now I’m trying to lean out and gain mass at the same time. I’m doing a bit of everything. I start on the treadmill. Then I do weights. I’ll do stuff with a resistance band. Sometimes, it’s kettle bell work. I’ll also do walking lunges, jump squats and some lighter weights.
