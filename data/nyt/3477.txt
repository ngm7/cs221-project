The word picayune has appeared in 46 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Aug. 10 in the book review “‘A Terrible Country’ That’s Impossible Not to Love” by Boris Fishman:

The poise, alas, falters in the book’s final stretch. Prose that until now has felt tolerably colloquial — a friend emailing you about his crazy year in Moscow (“the distances were unbelievable”) — goes fully slack (“It was great”), and what has felt disarmingly garrulous turns, once again, picayune: With great pride, Andrei relates a multi-page chronicle of unclogging a drain.

There’s an unpronounceable Russian word that literally means “to choke,” as on water while swimming, but metaphorically refers to being so excited about something that you’re all but choking on the words. (For the masochists out there, it’s “zakhlebyvatsya.”) Occasionally, Andrei feels so caught up in the euphoria of finding fluency and belonging at last that the story resembles this type of undiscerning cascade.
