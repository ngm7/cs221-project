Of all the things to make in an electric pressure cooker, pasta seems low on the list. Neither dense nor tough, it doesn’t require the kind of cartilage-melting tenderization you get under pressure. And since pasta cooks so quickly in a regular pot, you’re not going to save any time.

But nothing beats an electric pressure cooker in terms of convenience, especially when it comes to spaghetti and meatballs.

Before I got my cooker, spaghetti and meatballs was on the menu maybe once a year, much to the dismay of my pasta-loving tween. It’s not a hard dish to make, but it dirtied too many pans for the average weeknight meal, yet wasn’t special enough to gain weekend-project status.

The electric pressure cooker streamlines the process, reducing the number of pans from three to one.
