Seeing a limousine inch its way down a one-way street during rush hour always raises more questions than answers. Who’s behind those tinted windows? Why are they paying such a premium to travel in a glorified taxi? And, wait, how did the driver just pull off that turn?

The photographer Kathy Shorr found the answers to these pedestrian mysteries during her short-lived career as a limo driver. Needing steady work after graduating from the School of Visual Arts in 1988, she began chauffeuring. Clients were not necessarily the rich and famous, but everyday people heading to bashes around town — from flower girls in frilly dresses and pearled headbands, to men rocking white tuxedos and mullets on their way to a quinceañera.
