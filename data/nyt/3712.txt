The Rangers knew that this season would be peppered with a fresh set of challenges after trading away several veterans last season, bringing in a new coach and pivoting toward a rebuild with several young players.

And after a 3-7-1 start, there were encouraging signs as the team surged with a 9-1-1 run, buoyed by vintage performances from goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, timely goals and a resilient young defense. But now, with the Rangers going 2-5-3 in their last 10 games, the frustration is starting to build. And after a third straight extra-time loss at home, the 36-year-old Lundqvist, who has vowed to stay a Ranger despite the rebuilding process, appeared to have had enough.

“Mistakes are going to happen — I make mistakes — but we can’t accept not being ready to fight,” Lundqvist said after a 37-save performance in a 4-3 overtime loss Sunday afternoon to the Vegas Golden Knights. “The position we are in, you have to battle every night. You can’t lose your focus like we did.”

The loss to Vegas was only the latest collapse at home. The Rangers had squandered 3-0 leads in their two previous games at Madison Square Garden — a shootout loss to Winnipeg on Dec. 2 and a 4-3 overtime defeat to the Arizona Coyotes that was capped by a goal from the former Ranger Derek Stepan.
