How long should the makeup artist stay?

That depends on you, your finances and how many people the artist will be working on. Prices can range from $300 for just the bride and one sitting, to $4,000 for the day, which can also include three or four people. “You can book a ‘do and go’ where the artist does your makeup and leaves you the powder and lipstick,” Ms. Lee said. “Or a flat rate for the whole day, say six to eight hours, which includes everything from first looks through post reception.” To cut costs, some brides are opting for a “do and return,” where the artist leaves after the first application and returns to reapply before the reception. This is especially helpful for brides opting for a second outfit. “Since the color of the dress has changed, their makeup does, too,” Mr. Guyton said.

A Quick To-Do List

Start looking for your makeup artist 60 days before the wedding. Too far out and your hair is still growing and your skin still changing.

Take a test drive, or two or three with a makeup artist you might consider hiring. It’s a service worth paying extra for. During this time you can view the person’s makeup kit and products. Dirty makeup bag and brushes: red flag.

Schedule in hair and makeup time. Ninety minutes for each bridal party person, and three hours for the bride should work.

Have a tip handy for the makeup artist. The standard is 10 to 20 percent of the bill.

Prepare to pay before you put on your dress. “If your bridal party is paying for themselves, ask your maid of honor to collect the money beforehand,” said Ms. Glazer. “It’s uncomfortable for us to walk around the room asking for payment.”
