Liza Redfield, who broke a barrier on July 4, 1960, when she raised her baton at the Majestic Theater to start a performance of “The Music Man,” becoming the first woman to be the full-time conductor of a Broadway pit orchestra, died on Dec. 23 in Manhattan. She was 94.

Her death, at the Amsterdam Nursing Home, was announced by Barbara Sandler, her longtime friend and caregiver.

Other women had served as assistant conductors and might have filled in on Broadway podiums, but Ms. Redfield was widely reported to be the first engaged full time when she took over “The Music Man,” the crowd-pleasing musical with a score by Meredith Willson, which had been running since 1957. She replaced Herbert Greene, the show’s original conductor as well as one of its producers, and the changeover made news.

“Woman Conducts ‘Music Man’ Today,” The New York Times announced in a headline. Time magazine, in gushingly sexist language typical of the period, rhapsodized, “With striking Titian-red hair, plus face and figure to match, Liza Redfield has the looks for anything except what she is: Broadway’s first full-time woman conductor.”
