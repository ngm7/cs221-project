Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

TED ALEXANDRO at the Creek and the Cave (Dec. 14-15, 7 p.m.). Alexandro released one of the best stand-up comedy specials of the year (my words, describing his words) with “Senior Class of Earth.” The comedian practices what he preaches, whether it’s onstage at the Comedy Cellar making fun of his peer Louis C.K., or marching in the streets with fellow activists. As co-founder of the New York Comedians Coalition, he successfully organized the first pay raise in decades for hundreds of city comics. Find out what’s on his mind these days as he works on developing a new hour of material during his “Week at the Creek” residency.
