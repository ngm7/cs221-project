ALL THE LIVES WE NEVER LIVED

By Anuradha Roy

288 pp. Atria. $26.

“The past is a foreign country” is a much-quoted line from the 1953 novel “The Go-Between,” in which an adult, piecing together fragments of memory, begins to understand how the past has affected him. In many ways this feels strikingly similar to Anuradha Roy’s newest novel, “All the Lives We Never Lived,” in which the adult Myshkin reflects on the course of his life, which was derailed when his brilliant and frustrated Bengali mother fled with her German lover in the late 1930s, abandoning him and his father, an Anglo-Indian academic turned freedom-fighting ascetic.

The novel alternates between the months surrounding his mother’s betrayal and some 60 years later, when Myshkin is reading old letters his mother wrote to a close friend about her departure from India and life in Bali.

Myshkin’s mother, Gayatri, was the pampered daughter of a freethinker who encouraged her love of dance and painting and who traveled abroad with her before his untimely death. Her unconventional interests and worldly experience made her ill suited for the Indian marriage mart, and the only man who would have her was Myshkin’s father, Nek.

The relationship between Gayatri and Nek, a condescending and dismissive pedant, was doomed from the start. Nek deems Gayatri’s talents in painting and music mere hobbies, frivolous compared with his more dignified interests. While he theoretically believes in freedom for women, and lectures his family nightly on the vitality of the Indian independence movement, Nek is far more conventional than he believes, subjecting his wife to his rules and making it clear that her freedoms are at his indulgence.
