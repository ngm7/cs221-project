Hi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes, a newsletter devoted to dinner. This is decidedly Not Dinner, but we just had a cookie swap with the NYT Cooking team in the office.

Among the stars were recipes people made by our own amazing Alison Roman: her salted pistachio shortbread, these chocolate-molasses numbers and The Cookie itself, the internet-famous salted chocolate chunk shortbread. The internet is also loving Alison’s new spiced chickpea stew (a.k.a. The Stew), which was featured here last week.

That prompted me to ask what she’s cooking for dinner lately. She wrote back: “Honestly, these days I am making so much broth because it doesn’t require my attention and the result is something I can use immediately or freeze for later.” She flavors it with turmeric, a cinnamon stick, star anise or dried chiles, “or just an insane amount of garlic when I’m making it rather than after, so when it defrosts it’s pretty much ready to go (R.T.G.).” She turns it into a quick soup with celery and toasted garlic over rice noodles, greens and whatever vegetables are lurking in her fridge.

I love the R.T.G. concept and lifestyle. Send me your R.T.G. ideas or just drop me a line at dearemily@nytimes.com.
