Nothing lasts. Life goes on, full of surprises.

The raunchy, not-so-politically-correct puppets in the musical “Avenue Q” are only — ahem — “For Now.” The show will be closing its Off Broadway run at New World Stages, where it has played since 2009, in April. The cast and crew members were notified of the closing after Monday night’s show.

“Every show has its life span and we’ve done well for 15 years and chances are at some point in the next year, our advances are going to go down because there are going to be so many other wonderful shows around,” Robyn Goodman, one of the producers, said in a phone interview. “We’d like to just go out on a high.”

With songs like “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist” and characters with vulgar names such as Lucy the Slut, the musical — created by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, with a book by Jeff Whitty — was an unusual match for Broadway when it opened at the John Golden Theater in 2003.

But the show became a hit there, recouping a $3.5 million investment in less than a year. It unexpectedly won the Tony Award for best musical in 2004, beating out “Caroline, or Change,” “The Boy From Oz” and “Wicked.”
