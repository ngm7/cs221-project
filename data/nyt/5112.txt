The governor of the Mexican state of Puebla and her husband, a lawmaker who was the former governor of the same state, were killed in a helicopter crash on Monday, according to Mexican officials and news media reports.

The governor, Martha Erika Alonso, took office just 10 days ago. She was the first female governor of her state.

Her husband, Rafael Moreno Valle, was once considered a rising political star of the center-right National Action Party. He governed Puebla, in central Mexico, from 2011 to 2017, and at one point was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. More recently, he was a federal senator.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose election in July upended the nation’s political establishment, offered his “deepest condolences” to their families on Monday and ordered the government to look into what happened.
