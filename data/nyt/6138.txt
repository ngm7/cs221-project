Louis Rudd on Friday became the second person to cross Antarctica solo and unassisted, two days after Colin O’Brady of Portland, Ore., became the first.

O’Brady, 33, and Rudd, 49, a captain in the British Army, began the trek as a race on Nov. 3.

Rudd finished his journey on Day 56 at the foot of Leverett Glacier at 2:21 p.m. Eastern Time, a little more than 48 hours after O’Brady completed his expedition.

“It’s nice, when you’re finished, that you’re in the polar history books,” Rudd said by satellite phone Friday night. “But it’s all about the journey.”

Rudd’s trek covered 925 miles, according to his main sponsor, Shackleton, a British apparel company. Like O’Brady, he did the journey solo, unsupported by supply drops or similar help, and unaided by kites or other devices to harness the wind to help pull his heavy load.
