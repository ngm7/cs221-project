An 831-square-foot vacant ground-floor retail space in white-box condition, with a usable 1,320-square-foot selling basement and a 456-square-foot patio, is available in Ian Schragerâ€™s recently built 15-story luxury condominium overlooking the Hudson River in the West Village. The white concrete building, with diamond-faceted windows and an undulating facade, was designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, which also designed the Museum of the 20th Century in Berlin. Apartments in the building range from about $5 million to more than $40 million. The retail space features 25-foot-high ceilings and windows on three sides on the ground floor, and 10-foot, 8-inch ceilings on the lower level.
