MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — An unusual trickle of drama seeped out of Alabama’s buttoned-up football program earlier this month when it was reported that the former Maryland coach D.J. Durkin was spending time with the Crimson Tide coaching staff in Tuscaloosa.

Durkin had been fired as Maryland’s coach in the fall after a university investigation prompted by the death of a player after a strenuous practice. Once hailed as a rising coaching star, Durkin departed amid a hail of criticism and was broadly regarded as toxic, at least temporarily, in college football. His apparent involvement with Alabama, the exemplary team of this era, one that was preparing to face Oklahoma on Saturday in a College Football Playoff semifinal, rattled many observers.

In response to the controversy, Coach Nick Saban quickly issued a statement in which he clarified that Durkin had not been hired in any capacity and that his presence was limited to “professional development.”

“He is simply observing our operation as many other coaches have done through the years,” Saban said.
