Re “Asked About Santa, Trump Questions Child” (news article, Dec. 26):

You report that on Christmas Eve, President Trump asked a child named Collman, “Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7, it’s marginal, right?”

Young Collman could have responded along these lines: “Do you still believe that your trade war is good for the United States? Or that coal is coming back? Or that it’s Democrats who shut down the federal government? With all due respect, Mr. President, my fairy tale makes a lot more sense than yours. Merry Christmas.”

A Christmas wish: that our president would start lying to 7-year-olds and begin telling the truth to the rest of us.
