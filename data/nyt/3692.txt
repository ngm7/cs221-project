PARIS — With the so-called Yellow Vest movement forcing concessions that have widened the country’s budget shortfall, the French government is accelerating a plan to place hefty taxes on American technology giants that have long maneuvered to keep their bills low while reaping huge sums of money.

France has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal.

Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said last week that France would move ahead on its own if the union did not approve such a tax by March.

On Monday, he moved up that date.

“The tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,” Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to “fight with me” on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, “It’s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.”
