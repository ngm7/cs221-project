LAS VEGAS — At the betting tables in Las Vegas, exhilarating highs and devastating lows are commonplace. For the city’s N.H.L. team, the Golden Knights, that volatility may have transferred to the ice.

After reaching the Stanley Cup finals in their inaugural year, the Golden Knights have spent much of this season toward the bottom of the standings.

“Everybody has bigger expectations for the team, and every player has bigger expectation for themselves,” goalie Marc-Andre Fleury said. “We all know we can be better and it feels like we should win every night. Maybe we were getting frustrated as a team thinking maybe we should get those wins.”

But of late, the Golden Knights (14-13-1) have been one of the N.H.L.’s hottest teams, adding another confounding piece to their brief but fascinating history. On Tuesday, they host the defending champion Washington Capitals in a finals rematch.
