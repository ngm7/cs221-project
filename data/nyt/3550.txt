The word rigamarole has appeared in six articles on NYTimes.com in the past seven years, including on June 2, 2015, in the Taking Note column “Do Millennials Need Fun Banking?” by Anna North:

Qapital’s app allows users to set up savings goals, upload pictures to illustrate them (“perhaps a beach in the sunshine, or a cool photo of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson”), then designate specific actions — like posting on social media or walking a certain number of steps — that will trigger deposits toward those goals.

.... The startup may well find its niche. Millennials, writes Danny Crichton at TechCrunch, aren’t satisfied with traditional banks (this of course leaves open the question of whether there are any age groups who are satisfied with traditional banks). “Every time I go to a bank,” he writes, “there is a rigamarole involved as we go through the new-account-type-of-the-month, each of course with their complex tiers of fees. I know this is designed to screw me, and I don’t like it. Simplicity is golden.”
