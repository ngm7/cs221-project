But Dr. Arnold and colleagues recently reported in a small study in Scientific Reports that they do have a circadian cycle. Like most other things about them, it is a bit peculiar. The variations are sometimes so slight that observing them required years of monitoring with sensitive sensors that sit in the reindeers’ stomachs.

Dr. Arnold and his collaborators used pill-shaped metal capsules containing the sensors. Once swallowed, the capsules stay harmlessly in the animal’s stomach as long as it lives, transmitting information about temperature, movement and heart rate. When the researchers looked at roughly two years of data from four reindeer, they saw interesting patterns.

“From our physiological data, it was clear from the first glance, the first analysis, that in body temperature there was clearly a diurnal rhythm,” said Dr. Arnold. Further analysis showed rhythms in other measurements, too.

In the months leading up to summer, there is sun but not yet much greenery. Then, t he cycles of the reindeers’ circadian clock have their highest highs and lowest lows, perhaps driving the animals to forage what is available during the day and prepare for what’s ahead.
