Mr. Mnuchin, who has a reputation for personally managing as many facets of the department as possible, said last year that he did not intend to fill the deputy position. However, Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Muzinich for the job in April.

The elevation of Mr. Muzinich comes as Mr. Mnuchin has been engrossed in trade negotiations with China and working to enforce new sanctions on Iran. The role of the deputy secretary is to run the day-to-day operations of the Treasury Department. With several senior Treasury positions still unfilled, however, Mr. Muzinich is likely to continue focusing heavily on the enforcement of the tax legislation, financial regulation and legislative affairs.

Mr. Muzinich’s role could become even more critical given that Mr. Trump has considered Mr. Mnuchin as a possible candidate to be his next chief of staff. Mr. Mnuchin, however, has indicated that he prefers his current position at Treasury.

In an administration that is ideologically split between so-called Wall Street globalists and economic nationalists, Mr. Muzinich, who holds a business degree from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, fits comfortably in the camp of the New York bankers. He previously worked at Morgan Stanley and was the president of Muzinich & Company, an international investment firm founded by his father.

Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich was policy director for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign and helped write Mr. Bush’s tax plan.
