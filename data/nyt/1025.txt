It’s a privilege and necessity of my job to drink many wines over the course of a year. All have a story to tell, sometimes dull, other times fascinating. Some are simply unforgettable.

The wines that stay with me are not always the best or the most profound. Sometimes the surprise of a discovery can transform the perception of a wine’s potential. More often, it’s a wine that so completely captures the spirit and emotion of a moment that it brands the memory with its scent and flavor.

What follows, from young to old, are a dozen remarkable wines, with stories that endure.

Rediscovering wines I had taken for granted is perhaps the most gratifying part of my job. Such was the case with silvaner, sometimes spelled sylvaner, the product of a workhorse Teutonic grape that has lost ground to more profitable varieties. But when made with care and appreciation, it can be a wonderfully fresh springtime wine and, as I learned, much more.
