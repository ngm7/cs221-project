To hip-hop artists, he was the supplier of endless beats and grooves. To Stephen Sondheim acolytes, he was the composer of the show that beat “Follies” for the Best Musical Tony Award. And to generations of musical theater fans, Galt MacDermot was the guy who looked out of place in a picture on the back of the “Hair” cast recording.

MacDermot, who died Dec. 18 at the age of 89, had far less hair than his “Hair” co-creators, James Rado and Gerome Ragni. His was cut in a high-and-tight style that fit perfectly with his necktie and white dress shirt — and that completely clashed with his Dionysian collaborators.

But while he resembled a wallflower at the free-love orgy, MacDermot spent the next 50 years cultivating a reputation as one of the funkiest composers Broadway had ever seen. His layered, sinuous grooves were catnip for such rap legends as Busta Rhymes and J Dilla, who sampled his music. He spiced up Shakespeare in the 1971 musical “Two Gentlemen of Verona” (the show that won instead of “Follies”) and gave the 1970 proto-blaxploitation film “Cotton Comes to Harlem” a glut of wah-wah pedals.

Still, with its seemingly endless bounty of timeless songs, “Hair” remains the defining work in MacDermot’s career. Generations of musical theater composers have integrated rock music into their own scores with a freedom and stylistic flexibility that he helped make possible. Here several of those songwriters, along with a few other theater and hip-hop notables, share their memories and appreciations of MacDermot. These are edited excerpts from their comments.
