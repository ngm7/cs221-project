Happy New Year, everyone! Thank you for making 2018 a successful year for the New York Times climate team, and for the Climate Fwd: newsletter. Our newsletter subscriptions more than doubled this year, and that’s thanks to you, our readers, for sharing our work with your friends, families and colleagues.

This year, we traveled to places like Easter Island, Kenya and Alaska to cover the effects of climate change and the trade-offs of environmental policies. We also covered the resignations of two cabinet secretaries and the implications of landmark scientific reports. And, we showed you how global warming has affected your hometown, and what could still happen there in your lifetime.

We’ve collected these and other highlights in our feature called “2018: The Year in Climate Change.” You should definitely check it out. But we also asked some of our reporters and editors to share their personal favorite moments from the year. Here’s what Somini, John, Kendra and Jonathan had to say.
