The dancer and choreographer Raja Feather Kelly has been named the 2019-20 Randjelovic/Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist at New York Live Arts, the organization announced Tuesday.

The program offers midcareer artists $390,000 in support that includes a two-year residency with health benefits and services to develop a commission for New York Live Arts. Mr. Kelly, 31, plans to work with his company, the Feath3r Theory, on a “dream project” of his: a retelling of the 1975 movie “Dog Day Afternoon.”

“Raja is simply unclassifiable, driven by discipline and something akin to a belligerent attack on the commonplace, the mild, the uncommitted,” the New York Live Arts artistic director Bill T. Jones and associate artistic director Janet Wong said in a statement.

“One leaves a performance of Raja’s infected by his curiosity, love of craft and just plain outrageousness,” Mr. Jones and Ms. Wong said. “We look forward to this residency and we celebrate this singular artist.”
