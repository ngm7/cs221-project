And it was misleading the board that denied him the $120 million payout promised in his contract if he wasn’t fired for cause. “His willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract, as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the company’s investigation,” allowed the company to withhold the money, the CBS board said in a statement.

That’s because his most recent contract stipulated that “cause” means only a felony conviction, fraud, failure to cooperate fully with an investigation, or a violation of company policies. Allegations of sexual harassment — which is, to repeat, illegal, although it may not be a felony — did not count. It would have been even harder to hold him to account if the acts happened before he joined the company, even if they had gone unpunished by a former employer.

So while the company’s investigation did find that Mr. Moonves “engaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace,” that wasn’t enough to oust him without a huge payoff. It was only after he was also found to have deleted texts in which he tried to silence one of his accusers and lied to the company’s investigators that they were able to withhold it. Had he played by the rules, Mr. Moonves may very well have walked away with his loot. (The fight isn’t over; Mr. Moonves could still challenge the board’s decision, and if he does, his termination deal requires CBS to foot his legal costs.)

Mr. Moonves has denied all the allegations and said that any sexual acts he engaged in were consensual.
