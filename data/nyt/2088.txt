As a political reporter for The Herald, Fiedler broke the story that Hart was seen with a woman who wasn’t his wife, news that upended Hart’s campaign. The story was published after a Herald team, which included Fiedler, staked out Hart’s home following an anonymous tip — a move that was much criticized at the time. Hart and the woman, Donna Rice, then a 29-year-old actress and pharmaceutical representative, have said they were just friends.

Fiedler wrote in his letter, which was shared with reporters, that the movie vilifies him and doesn’t take into account the accuracy of his reporting. Further, he wrote, the actor who portrays him, Steve Zissis, never contacted him. “I wonder if Steve Zissis ever went to the trouble of finding a photograph of me, much less researched my reputation. Had he done so, he would have known I’ve never worn a beard; that I take pride in my appearance and in my physical fitness.”

Fiedler said in the letter that the negative portrayal could sway potential students from applying to Boston University, where Fiedler, who started in 2008, is in his final year as a dean. (This reporter attended Boston University’s College of Communication from 2006 to 2010.)

Though it was shut out of Golden Globe nominations on Thursday, “The Front Runner” has awards season hopes, and Fiedler said in an email that members of the communication school’s advisory board were concerned that the film might damage the university’s reputation and encouraged him to make public his criticisms.

In an October interview before the movie was released, he said that after a private screening, he told Reitman that he had “directed a terrific story and captures the action,” as well as “the frenetic activity that goes on in a campaign.”
