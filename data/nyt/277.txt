There was a head coach fired before him, and there will be head coaches fired after him, but no firing this year can truly compare to the Green Bay Packers cutting ties with Mike McCarthy.

It may sound like a take on the old breakup line, but the significance of the firing has little to do with McCarthy — it’s all about the team that fired him.

In their 98 seasons, the Packers have had just 15 head coaches. One has his name on the team’s stadium (Curly Lambeau), one has his name on the Super Bowl trophy (Vince Lombardi), and another won five championships as a player (Bart Starr). None of the 14 coaches before McCarthy were fired midseason.

Considering how rarely this position opens up, the Packers’ coaching vacancy might be one of the most coveted jobs in recent sports history.
