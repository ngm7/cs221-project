When it launches in spring 2020, the 126-passenger National Geographic Endurance from Lindblad Expeditions will have amenities on par with a luxury vessel, including two restaurants, a glass-walled yoga studio, an infinity Jacuzzi facing the stern and two saunas with panoramic windows so heat-bathers won’t miss the passing scenery. Such features aren’t uncommon on larger ships, but they may be the first to sail in northeast Greenland and along the Northeast Passage from Norway across Russia.

Generally associated with small ships bound for remote locales, expedition cruising has historically focused on the destination rather than the conveyance. Ships were strictly base camps for Zodiac trips to view the icebergs of Antarctica or hike game trails in remote Alaska.

Now the vessels themselves are getting an upgrade from Lindblad and several other lines, freeing passengers from choosing between adventure and comfort.

“The ship was just a place to lay your head at night, but there is a real growing segment that wants more,” said Colleen McDaniel, the senior executive editor of Cruise Critic, the online review site. “They want hard-charging experiences in port and onboard they want some luxury and space. That’s a niche that a lot of cruise lines are trying to fill.”
