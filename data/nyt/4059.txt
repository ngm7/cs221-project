Twenty years ago this week, the House of Representatives forwarded articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton to the Senate. Whether or not that was constitutionally warranted — it wasn’t — does any citizen on either side who witnessed or participated in that partisan dust-up honestly look back on it as an exemplary exercise showcasing Americans’ shared reverence for the rule of law? I’m thinking specifically of how the House Judiciary Committee member Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, mentioned that his office got a call from someone who hoped he would die “a painful death from prostate cancer.”

Given that President Trump, a Republican (or thereabouts), is at the center or periphery of numerous federal investigations, including inquiries with whiffs of high crimes like conspiring with a hostile foreign power and accepting emoluments, and given that the incoming House of Representatives, the body constitutionally charged with presidential indictment, will be majority Democrat, a 2019 impeachment is not unthinkable.

That said, conviction, leading to removal, requires a nearly impossible two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. Which did not stop me from wasting three hours pondering the logistical, moral and civil rights implications of handing over a job with 18-hour work days to Vice President Mike Pence, who reportedly refuses to dine alone with any woman who is not his wife. I had some policy quibbles with George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice, but I never once doubted their ability to share a sandwich while discussing the Triangle of Death. So the consequences of impeachment are almost as unpredictable as the crap shoot that is election.

Now, in the cold and quiet of late December, is the time to do homework, to bone up on impeachment’s legal intricacies and precedents so as to face the months ahead with a mutual resolve to be, if not gracious — gracious was never the point of the House of Representatives — then prepared.
