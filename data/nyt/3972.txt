Good morning.

Or as some of you reading this might say, “magandang umaga,” or “buenos días,” or “jó reggelt.”

It might not even be morning to you. Maybe you’re stumbling across this as you end your shift or maybe you’re traveling.

No matter where you are, or what time it is, I wanted to say hi. I’m your new California Today correspondent. You’ve probably seen my byline at the top of this newsletter over the last few weeks, and if you’ve been reading for a while, you may have seen this note from my editors explaining a little about my background.

Today, I’m officially introducing myself.

I’m a California native — born at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. But when I was 2, my dad got a good job in Kansas City, so my parents packed up and left the place where they grew up for the Midwest.
