Margot Kidder’s only child, Maggie McGuane, wasn’t sure she wanted to talk with me. Margot died in May, when, her manager said, she was found having passed peacefully in her sleep. But a few months later, the coroner’s office released a statement that Margot died from “a self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose” — a suicide. A fuller report said that she was “well-known to law enforcement as relating to drug and alcohol issues.” Maggie spoke to the media for the first time then. “It’s a big relief that the truth is out there,” she told The Associated Press. “It’s important to be open and honest so there’s not a cloud of shame in dealing with this.” She didn’t speak publicly about her mother again.

Maggie isn’t particularly private, she told me on the phone. It’s just that she wasn’t quite sure what to say. It was hard to live in the same town as Margot had (Livingston, Mont.) and hear people repeat the old myths about her own mother. Should her mother be remembered how her mother wanted to be remembered — as a woman who was somehow able to be an accomplished actress, a loving mother, a dedicated activist and a doting grandmother? Should her mother be remembered as she actually was? Could Maggie tell the truth about how difficult it had always been with Margot — aren’t you always supposed to lie a little in these end-of-the-year tributes? Who is in charge of a person’s memory? We’ve collectively agreed that in our in memoriams a person’s harder edges are sanded down. But is that the right thing to do? Which is the actual tribute? Maybe, she thought, it was best not to talk about it at all.
