JOHANNESBURG — A South African anti-corruption agency has called for a police investigation into the killings of three political figures who had accused their rivals of corruptly diverting money intended for the renovation of a community hall.

The public protector’s office said in a report released Thursday that the police should investigate “the root causes” and “motivations” behind the gangland-style killings of the politicians from the governing African National Congress, who had denounced the project as a vehicle to funnel money to local officials and business allies.

The public protector also called for an investigation into leaders of the rural town of Umzimkhulu who were involved in the project, which contractors have failed to complete despite spending millions of dollars.

The town improperly awarded the contract to renovate the hall, even failing to obtain the proper permits to work on a heritage building, according to the public protector, the government agency responsible for investigating official misconduct and corruption.
