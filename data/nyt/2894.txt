During the nearly two decades he dominated the alliance of Renault and Nissan, Carlos Ghosn achieved something of a miracle in the auto world. He managed to get the French and Japanese companies to act as one entity so both could prosper in an industry where scale is everything.

Now that Mr. Ghosn is in a Tokyo jail, and both he and Nissan face criminal charges of illegally underreporting his income, the flaws in that structure have become obvious.

Mr. Ghosn’s fall has left the unlikely Franco-Japanese union in limbo and revealed how much of its success revolved around his forceful personality. Mr. Ghosn was invested with more powers and ruled far longer than is typical for large, publicly traded corporations.

Mr. Ghosn had not cultivated a clear successor, and that leaves the alliance’s survival in doubt: Neither Nissan nor Renault has a plan for preserving the arrangement that has been a juggernaut, accounting for sales of 10.6 million autos last year. Nissan decided to investigate Mr. Ghosn without giving Renault a heads-up.
