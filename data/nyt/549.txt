One of the clichés of modern journalism is the faux-gotcha story about Republicans and fiscal conservatism. Such stories contrast the Republican Party’s reputation for caring about the budget with some action — like the Trump tax cut — that adds to the deficit .

The problem is, journalists have now been writing these gotchas for almost 40 years, because Republicans have not been fiscal conservatives for a very long time. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both caused the deficit to rise. More recent Republican leaders — like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell — have also been profligate with taxpayer dollars. They pass huge tax cuts, mostly for the rich, and don’t particularly care about the effect on the federal budget.

But there is still one major modern Republican who deserves the label of fiscal conservative: George H.W. Bush.
