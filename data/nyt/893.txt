Re “A Day of Pageantry Fit for a Political Patriarch” (front page, Dec. 6):

Former President George H.W. Bush’s death and the solemn pageantry of his funeral are providing Americans with a fleeting glimpse of nostalgia for a more stable and saner era in our national life. The processions of aging mourners, like the president they served and in many cases revered, include mostly good public servants who, like their boss, had a loyalty to their country that transcended politics.

Sadly, in recent years, anger, blame and even an absence of humor have defined our politics and have dampened the national mood. A week of mourning for a president who embodied so many positive qualities will do little to change that. But as Americans come together in a time of collective grief and celebration, it is refreshing and reassuring to witness even a brief emergence of civility.

Re “George Bush: A Life Story Shared in Longhand” (news article, Dec. 4):

I never supported George H.W. Bush’s politics, especially his use of the Willie Horton ad, but I never knew about his prolific personal communications. His longhand messages communicated a strong commitment to respect for all people, regardless of political positions.

His letters opened a window into Mr. Bush as a wonderful, caring humanitarian. The letters have totally changed my opinion of him.
