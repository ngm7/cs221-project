She added, “He’s still tough and fit and resilient and a champion of the underdog.”

The animated series will also make other updates. A clean-shaven Bluto, for example, is interested in stealing Popeye’s spinach more than he is the heart of Olive Oyl, who has cast aside the role of damsel in distress. More independent woman now, she helps vanquish Bluto in the first episode.

The 25 two-minute shorts are aimed at a young audience, having been produced by WildBrain, whose programming network includes the children’s program “Yo Gabba Gabba!” The episodes have sound effects but no dialogue, a nod to YouTube’s global reach.

The shorts will be “as funny here as they will be in Bangladesh,” said Neeraj Khemlani, the president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, which owns King Features.

Popeye, who was created by E. C. Segar and made his first appearance as part of the King Features strip “Thimble Theatre” on Jan. 17, 1929, is the latest newspaper comic strip character to undergo a spit and polish. The schoolgirl Nancy, who was created in 1933, began referring to Snapchat in April. And the cave man Alley Oop, whose prehistoric adventures began in 1932 and whose strip ended in September, will return in January with an emphasis on humor, including an exploration of his early middle school years.
