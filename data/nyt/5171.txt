MONDAY PUZZLE — First, Wordplay would like to wish those who celebrate a very merry erev Christmas (if you are wondering, “erev” means the night before a holiday).

Brendan Emmett Quigley returns with a crossword puzzle that has nothing to do with the holiday, unless you consider that many people travel to be with others at Christmas. Even so, I hope they choose a safer means of travel than what Mr. Quigley suggests in his theme.

Tricky Clues

Not a lot that was tricky in my opinion, but a few things that the clues brought up for me:

5A: ALICE Cooper of hard rock fame, as the clue says, portrayed King Herod in the electrifying “Jesus Christ Superstar Live” starring John Legend. If you can find it in its entirety on YouTube, it’s well worth a watch.
