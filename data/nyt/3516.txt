PARIS — Robert Lepage would like you to know that he doesn’t shy away from controversy. To make his point, the Canadian director renamed his latest project, “Kanata,” which was briefly canceled in July after an outcry about cultural appropriation, then revived, and, ultimately, had its world premiere in Paris on Saturday. Now it’s called “Kanata — Episode 1 — The Controversy,” and runs through Feb. 17.

It’s not the only sign that Mr. Lepage and the French company Théâtre du Soleil, which is staging the play, have let the kerfuffle overwhelm them. “Kanata” was supposed to delve into the troubled relationship between Canada’s Indigenous people and their colonizers. The final product does explore the plight of the country’s First Nations, but it does so through the defensive gaze of a white artist who can’t resist telling us that he, too, has been victimized.

Mr. Lepage has been plagued by accusations of cultural insensitivity this year. Performances of his production “SLAV,” inspired by African-American slave songs, were halted in Montreal after an outcry because it featured a predominantly white cast. Then came “Kanata” and an open letter from Indigenous artists and activists, published in the Quebec newspaper Le Devoir in July. In it, the authors accused Mr. Lepage and the Théâtre du Soleil of seeking to tell their stories without Indigenous input.

Shortly after, the production’s North American co-producers withdrew their financial support and it was called off. (Activists said that they never asked for that to happen, only for inclusion.) In September, however, Ariane Mnouchkine, the founder and director of the Théâtre du Soleil, announced that the company would stage the production after all, as part of the Festival d’Automne, a yearly arts event in Paris. Ms. Mnouchkine used the opportunity to rail against what she called the “censorship” of the play in Canada.
