PARIS — Paris braced for a fourth weekend of protests as the government warned of the potential for new violence and officials prepared to deploy tens of thousands of police officers throughout France and even armored vehicles in the capital.

Hundreds of people had gathered early Saturday around the Arc de Triomphe, which was damaged in rioting a week ago. A crowd of “Yellow Vests” protesters were marching down the Champs-Élysées in central Paris, surrounded by exceptional police security amid fears of new violence.

On Saturday, the police prefecture of Paris said more than 300 people had been arrested by 9 a.m.

The original “Yellow Vest” protests were dominated by working-class people from the provinces upset over a gasoline tax increase and their declining living standards. They adopted fluorescent roadside safety vests as their signature, symbolizing their economic distress.

But officials fear that the protests have been co-opted by far more violent elements taking advantage of the insurrectional climate and that “Round 4,” as Saturday’s demonstrations are being called, could be more violent than ever.
