VARIETY PUZZLE — It’s been a while since we last solved a diagramless crossword. I’d liken this type of puzzle to a very high-concept dessert, with hard drizzled caramel festooning an assortment of bonbons and decorative dabs of fudge on the rim of the plate — you know what I’m talking about. Delectable! But where to even begin?

Fortunately, we have one hint, which is that the grid has left-right symmetry; even without the additional little gimme of where the first across answer starts, if you can deduce the first three entries across and down I think you can start filling the grid in — I did, anyway, although I doubted myself for a good while.
