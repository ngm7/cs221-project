ROME — The construction of a new bridge to replace the viaduct that collapsed in Genoa last summer, killing 43 people, will be overseen by a native son of the city.

The authorities announced on Tuesday that they had chosen a design by the architect Renzo Piano for the bridge, which connects the western and eastern sections of the city and provides a critical link in the route to southern France.

Mr. Piano, who said he was deeply affected by the collapse of the Morandi Bridge, began working on a design for its replacement shortly after it fell in August. He said that he was donating his services as “an act of civic duty” and that he would also supervise the project.

Resembling the shape of a ship’s bow, the 202-million-euro ($230-million) bridge will be a joint venture by three Italian companies. The state railway subsidiary, Italferr, will handle the engineering, with construction done by a major Italian company, Salini Impregilo, and the infrastructure subsidiary of the state-run shipbuilder Fincantieri.
