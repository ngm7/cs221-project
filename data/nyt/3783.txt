John Ford Noonan, a playwright who enjoyed a prolific three-decade run marked by one particularly big Off Broadway hit, “A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking,” died on Sunday at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, N.J., where he lived. He was 77.

His brother, Tom Noonan, said the cause was heart failure.

“A Coupla White Chicks,” a two-hander about polar-opposite women who end up bonding — a template Mr. Noonan would use repeatedly — opened at the Astor Place Theater in the spring of 1980 with a stellar pairing: Susan Sarandon was Maude, “a no-nonsense, strait-laced WASP,” as Frank Rich’s review in The New York Times put it, and Eileen Brennan was Hannah Mae, “a vulgar, sexed-up émigré from Austin, Tex.”

“John Ford Noonan, the author of the evening, does not have much of import to say,” Mr. Rich wrote, “but when Miss Sarandon and Miss Brennan talk, we listen.”

The play, a comedy, ran for more than a year, the original stars giving way to other actresses, including Louise Lasser, JoBeth Williams, Susan Tyrrell, Anne Archer, Candy Clark and Carrie Snodgress. Works for two actresses were in short supply at the time, and “A Coupla White Chicks” was soon being performed all over the United States, its humor striking a universal chord.
