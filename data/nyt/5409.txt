This was the first Christmas I celebrated with my new husband and his family. In November, his sister sent a specific list of gifts for her and her three young kids (with links!). It was odd. My husband said he’d never received one before. But we’re big readers, so we went to the bookstore and chose books for everyone, instead. When we opened gifts, my sister-in-law was furious at me (but not at my husband) for buying off-list. She even asked me to take back the books when we left! I did. But how do we move forward? My husband offered to talk to her. She was lovely to me before.

SUZY

Look on the bright side, Suzy: At least you were spared a good old-fashioned book burning! Your husband was supportive to offer to speak to his sister. But it’s unlikely that this will be the last time anyone has to talk to her about this. Let’s establish your agency now.

Let’s also note that your sister-in-law seems to have some retrograde ideas about division of labor in a marriage: She sent a gift list to her brother only after he had a wife to execute it, and she was angry with you alone for going off script. If she hews to this notion of “women’s work,” the holidays must be exhausting with three young kids.

Of course, her list and her fury were ridiculous and rude. Still, I’d take the long view and ignore them (temporarily). Calling her out now, while she’s agitated, may just cause her to dig in her heels. Give her a chance to come to her senses on her own. We all mess up (and freak out) occasionally.
