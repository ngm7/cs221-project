Before reading the Opinion essay:

What do you know about the idea of resilience? What are some examples from your own life or events you have witnessed that show a person about to rebound — quickly or not so quickly — from disappointment?

From what you have seen, is the ability to cope with setbacks and carry on despite challenges something that people can get better at over time? Or are some people simply better equipped to deal with difficult situations?

Now, read the Opinion essay, “How to Be More Resilient,” and answer the following questions:

1. What did Gregory Miller and his colleagues hope to learn in the study they conducted in Chicago? What methods did they use?

2. What connection did they find exists between brain connectivity and the cardiometabolic health of young people in neighborhoods in which violence is common? What about among people of the same age who live in neighborhoods in which violence is less frequent?
