Celebrate Christmas Eve with an endearing comedy about a very tall, very happy elf. Or watch a holiday special by the Middle Collegiate Church.

What’s on TV

ELF (2003) 8:30 p.m. on AMC; also on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. It’s hard to imagine the titular character in this beloved Christmas comedy being played by anyone other than Will Ferrell. That “Holmes & Watson” star portrays Buddy, a gullible human raised by elves in the North Pole, who travels to New York to reconnect with his biological father, Walter (James Caan), a crusty children’s book editor. Walter reluctantly welcomes Buddy — easing him into the real world is not easy — and Buddy turns to Walter’s younger son (Daniel Tay) and a shy Gimbels employee (Zooey Deschanel) instead. “The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it,” the critic A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Whether you’re a fan of holiday films, comedy films or films in general, Ferrell’s performance is an absolute joy.

ANTIQUES ROADSHOW 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Still scrambling to find the right holiday present? In this “greatest gifts” episode, guests share prized possessions they received over the years (a Tiffany necklace, a Fender bass guitar) that turned out to have rich histories.

A BOLD NEW LOVE: A CHRISTMAS EVE WITH MIDDLE COLLEGIATE CHURCH (2018) 11:35 p.m. on CBS. This one-hour holiday special has something for everyone: gospel, classical music, dance and spoken word. A production of the Middle Collegiate Church in the East Village of Manhattan, the performances feature conducting by Tituss Burgess (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”) and songs from the movies “Sister Act 2” and “Selma.”
