Cres writes: My wife and I are celebrating our first Christmas in a new house. We collect both hot-air balloon and snowman tree ornaments as “symbols of our love.” Now that we have space, I would like to have separate, themed trees in separate rooms (one snowman tree, one hot-air balloon tree). My wife says one tree only.

This court applauds your knowledge of the very specific things that make you happy. But hoarding trees feels excessive in the season of giving and may serve to make your new neighbors worry about you. Also, why do you want to divorce your symbols of love on the first Christmas in your new house? Don’t banish the snowmen to the TV room! Let them frolic with hot-air balloons on one tree! Donate whatever you would have spent on bonus trees to charity.
