Traditionally male industries have made a comeback . The three fastest-growing sectors since December 2016 have been the three that are most male-dominated: mining, construction, and transportation and utilities. Yet in the same period women’s employment has increased more. It turns out that women are moving into these male-dominated fields, as well as a few others.

The question, though, is whether this is actually a boon for these new female employees. In the long run, it may not be . While some male-dominated fields have a promising growth outlook, that is not true for all of them — female -dominated occupations like health care are predicted to grow fastest in the long term.

Women in male-dominated workplaces also typically face more discrimination and harassment , including when they’re pregnant. And when they start working in a field in greater numbers, average pay tends to decline.

In comparing two 12-month periods — 2016 and December 2017 to November 2018 — employment in five male-dominated sectors grew 3.4 percent, versus 2.5 percent in the mixed and female-dominated sectors. (The other two male-dominated sectors are agriculture and manufacturing.)
