If only a New Year’s trip to Rio de Janeiro had met his expectations. “The truth of the matter is that it’s a big gay destination at that time of year,” he said. “So you fly 12 hours and then you look up on the beach and it’s a guy you saw at Equinox in West Hollywood.”

Here are some of his other observations about life away from home.

What kind of traveler are you?

I go on mini-long weekends throughout the year, but a week-to-10-day getaway usually only happens at the end of the year, when I’m exhausted and I just want to sit on a beach and be lazy and drink. Although this Christmas I’m trying to get some culture back in my life and I’m going to Paris and then London. I’ve actually never been to Paris, if you can believe it. So there’ll be museums, there’ll be fine dining. And there’ll be some shows in London. I want to see “Company.” I want to see “The Inheritance,” which is the big epic gay play.

On the plane do you sleep? Watch movies? Read books?

I have a hard time sleeping on planes for long periods of time. Once in a great while, I’ll watch a movie but it’s very rare. I usually use the flight as an opportunity to work, write, catch up on emails, or scroll Twitter. For hours at a time.

So you use Wi-Fi?

Always. My most recent flight from New York to L.A. last week, the Wi-Fi stopped working 20 minutes into the flight and never started up again. That drove me crazy. I don’t deal well with turbulence. If I can be on Twitter or Instagram and somehow be connected to people on the ground, that helps me not focus on the turbulence of the plane. I know this sounds crazy.
