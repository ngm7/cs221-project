In the lead-up to Christmas 2012, while living in Los Angeles, I set my heart on plum pudding. For once, I was going to eat the hot steamed dessert in the winter (admittedly a warm winter) , when it made sense, rather than in Australia’s sweltering summer.

Australia has adopted plum pudding, like so many things, from the British — and frosty British Christmases are perfect for a hot dessert. Plum pudding, for the sadly uninitiated, is a delicious steamed caky pudding made with the least delicious-sounding collection of ingredients (and no plums): bread crumbs, raisins, candied citrus peel, beef fat. Traditional recipes have you mix all this together and hang it in a cloth for a month, and then steam it, soak it in booze and light it on fire. It’s fantastic, I promise!

The greatest obstacle to making plum pudding in the United States is suet, a key ingredient. Suet — hard beef fat found around the animal’s kidneys — is not so easy to come by in Los Angeles, it turns out. Now that I’m back living in Australia, suet is easy to come by, but the idea of eating plum pudding in this heat seems insane.
