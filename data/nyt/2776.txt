Thursday’s forecast called for snow in New Jersey, but on one section of highway, something else was swirling through the air: cold, hard cash.

Around 8:30 a.m., a Brink’s armored truck was driving on Route 3 in East Rutherford, near the Meadowlands, when one of its doors malfunctioned and money blew out onto the roadway.

“There were $100 bills, 20s, 50s,” said Betsy Richards, 56, who was on a New Jersey Transit bus on her way to work in New York. “It was in all different denominations, but there was a lot of it and it was scattered all about.”
