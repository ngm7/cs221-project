One of the women who came forward on Friday, Gilberta Dominguez, 34, said that she was hired in 2016 at the golf club in Bedminster, N.J., after producing fake work documents. She and another immigrant, she said, who also lacked legal status in the United States, had been interviewed at the same time to work as housekeepers. She said they were told by the woman interviewing them, a member of the housekeeping staff, that they should not discuss their undocumented status.

“We said the papers are not good. She said it didn’t matter, but don’t talk about it,” recalled Ms. Dominguez, who is from Mexico. The woman who interviewed them, she said, filled out the application for them and took their fake Social Security and permanent resident cards.

Ms. Dominguez said she had worked at the golf club for about six months. It was in the middle of the presidential campaign, she said, and Mr. Trump had begun publicly calling for an end to illegal immigration and contending that criminals were flowing across the border. “I commented with other workers, ‘How can he call us criminals and drug addicts when we are right here working?’” she said, though she added that it did not prompt her to quit. “Our need was greater. Immigrants put up with a lot.”

Ultimately, what drove her to leave work one day in October 2016, she said, was what she perceived as mistreatment of undocumented workers on the part of the housekeeping supervisor, something that Ms. Morales had also complained of. “She called us ‘stupid people’ and would say, ‘This is America. Here they speak English, not Spanish,’” Ms. Dominguez recalled, speaking in Spanish.

“I couldn’t take it anymore,” she said. “She was rude. She humiliated us.”

Since leaving the golf club, she said, she has filed an application for asylum. In June, she received a temporary legal work permit, pending the resolution of her asylum case, and now works part-time packing goods at a distribution center not far from Bedminster.
