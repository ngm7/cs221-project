It was a typical, single-family house with a landscaped yard and Christmas decorations in a quiet neighborhood in eastern Pennsylvania. But this week investigators, acting on a tip, uncovered a secret in the basement — a drug operation worth an estimated $8 million a week.

On Wednesday, prosecutors announced that 11 people were charged with felony drug offenses in the bust, which was believed to be one of the largest in the county.

“This is a regular, middle-class, 9-to-5 neighborhood,” Matthew D. Weintraub, the Bucks County district attorney, said in an interview on Friday. “This is the place you would think of as Middle America.”

When Mr. Weintraub announced the drug bust on Wednesday during a news conference, local television stations showed footage of the house at 669 Cheryl Drive in Warminster Township and its broken window and door. Acting on an anonymous tip received in July, F.B.I., county and state law enforcement agents carried out the raid on Tuesday night.
