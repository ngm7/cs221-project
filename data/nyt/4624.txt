LeBron James’s first game in New York wearing purple and gold had all the fanfare of a big game even if the standings said otherwise. On his first possession against the Nets on Tuesday night, James drove hard to the basket, rose to the rim with a one-handed tomahawk slam — only to be rejected by 20-year-old Jarrett Allen.

“He’s in his 20s; I’m in my 30s. It takes me a little longer to warm up,” James said after the Lakers fell to the Nets, 115-110. “That’s fine with me. He’s a shot blocker. He can get a block. It happens. It’s probably all over social media. T hat’s cool.”

Though many in the sold-out Barclays Center came to see the King James version of Showtime, the Nets stole the spotlight, starting with Allen’s block. According to ESPN Stats & Information, it was the ninth time in James’s career he has had a dunk attempt blocked, and it came on his 1,850th try.

“That’s a hell of a list to be on,” Allen said. “He’s an amazing player. I got the chance to do it, so I’m on the list forever now.”
