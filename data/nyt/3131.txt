“If I didn’t do well, I would blame him,” she said.

In 2013, at the Symetra Classic in Charlotte, they fought about a particular shot. She scored 8 on a par-4 hole and followed it with a 6 on another par-4. She made the cut but was discouraged about her performance. “Wes was furious, so no consolation from him,” Ms. Chua said. “I sat in a field by myself and cried. I wanted someone to hold me and tell me it was going to be O.K. Wes wasn’t lovey-dovey boyfriend material, but being an athlete himself, he put my career first and made me a greater golfer when he was caddying for me, and I love him for that.”

“Wes is a wood-element dragon child meaning brave, strong and frank, while Jean is a fire-element rabbit child, diplomatic, considerate, generous and smart,” said her father Chua Beng Yap. “In the end, the male dragon is attracted to the tenderness and kindness of the female rabbit, and the female rabbit likes and appreciates the strong and brave male dragon.”

In 2014, when Mr. Griswold started his career as a business unit manager at Jabil, an electronic manufacturing services company based in St. Petersburg, Ms. Chua had to tour solo. “We argued more when we were apart, but texted frequently because we missed being together,” said Ms. Chua, who tried so hard to succeed that she began to deteriorate physically.

With elbow injuries and cubital tunnel syndrome that caused numbness in the hand and forearm pain needing surgery to correct, her game suffered. She didn’t want surgery and tried to work through the pain but realized it was time for a new career. In 2017, after discussions with Mr. Griswold who supported her decision, she left the tour and enrolled in the executive M.B.A. program at University of South Florida. She is now studying and working as an intern for Jabil’s chief of staff/strategy development manager in areas of automotive, smart home and appliances.
