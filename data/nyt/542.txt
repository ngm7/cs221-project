The Dia Art Foundation announced on Tuesday that it has acquired 155 sculptural works by the Minimalist artist Charlotte Posenenske. The pieces are from four series she created toward the end of her artistic career, before she abandoned art for sociology in 1968.

“It is rare to have an opportunity to bring a single artist’s work into our collection in such volume,” Jessica Morgan, the director of Dia Art Foundation, said in a statement. “This major acquisition exemplifies Dia’s unique commitment to sustained engagement with an artist’s practice.”

Dia:Beacon in Beacon, N.Y., one of the foundation’s exhibition spaces, will also host the first North American retrospective of Posenenske’s work, from March 8 through Sept. 9, 2019. The exhibition, titled “Charlotte Posenenske: Work in Progress,” will include pieces from throughout her 12-year period of artistic productivity.

After its stint in the Hudson Valley, the exhibition will tour internationally, with stops scheduled at the Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona in Spain, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen Düsseldorf in Germany and Mudam Luxembourg — Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean in Luxembourg.
