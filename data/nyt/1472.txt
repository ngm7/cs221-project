HOUSTON — The flashes came, at first, in jagged intervals: a sharp cut, a smooth scramble, an assertive plant-and-throw, the ball whistling toward a receiver. One after another, these flashes tantalized Deshaun Watson’s coaches and teammates on the Houston Texans, and in time they became expectations, and soon thereafter — a few games into this season, give or take — those expectations matured into a state of predictable comfort.

There was no revelatory moment. One day, it just sort of happened. Watson, one of the N.F.L.’s singular talents — a player who just might have set all sorts of rookie quarterback marks had he not torn a knee ligament, halting his 2017 season seven games in — resembled his former self in full, only a more refined version of it.

“Oh, he’s playing better than last year; I don’t think there’s any doubt,” Coach Bill O’Brien said of Watson. “He’s playing the game the way the Houston Texans need him to play the game.”

The Texans have not lost since September because of a methodology that refutes the N.F.L.’s movement toward bazillion-yard passing days and optional defense. In winning their last nine games heading into Sunday’s against Indianapolis, they have demonstrated an aptitude for denying points and running the ball — which, if one has monitored their travails over the last decade, has more or less been an organizational mission statement.
