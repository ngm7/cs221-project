Isabel Wilkerson’s award-winning “The Warmth of Other Suns” (2010) told the epic story of the Great Migration, the decades in the 20th century during which millions of African-Americans relocated from the rural South to the North, Midwest and West.

On this week’s podcast, Wilkerson discusses her review-essay about Michelle Obama’s best-selling memoir, “Becoming.” Obama’s family’s history is linked to the Great Migration. Wilkerson talks about how one of the former first lady’s grandfathers moved from South Carolina to Chicago, not straight north to the Washington or New York areas, which most people from that region of the South did.

“In some ways, that reflects to me a kind of breaking from the tradition or being more independent, striking out in a way that’s different from everyone else,” Wilkerson says. “I’d like to believe that that adds an element of independence and adventurousness to that side of her family.”
