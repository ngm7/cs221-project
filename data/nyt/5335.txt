Most of the filmgoers who seek out Yorgos Lanthimos’s awards contender “The Favourite” over the holiday break will see it at a multiplex, with the traditional before-feature presentation: copious trailers, commercials for the chain and perhaps a slick package of advertisements for upcoming releases packaged as “behind the scenes” content.

Audiences at Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn will get much more. The preshow for “The Favourite” includes a selection of the director Lanthimos’s short films and commercials, plus several samples of the star Olivia Colman’s offbeat TV sketch comedy work. The theater, which has run preshow reels since its opening in June 2011, has a practical use for these inventive clip collections: food and beverage service is available at patrons’ seats, so background entertainment encourages them to show up early to order their drinks and snacks.
