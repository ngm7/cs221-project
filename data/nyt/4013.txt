Of course, dancing is to be expected in a Broadway musical called “The Prom.” But the happiest surprise is what an unpretentious delight that dancing is.

In “The Prom,” directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, two musical theater actors from New York want to prove to the world that they’re not narcissists. Joined by a Juilliard graduate whose career is on the wane and a jaded chorus girl — she has quit “Chicago” after 20 years because the producers won’t give her a shot at playing Roxie Hart — they end up in Indiana, where a school has announced it will cancel the prom instead of allowing a gay student to attend with her girlfriend.

But there’s another lead character of sorts in “The Prom”: the ensemble. While the movement of the main players, the New York gang, is rooted in musical theater, the young dancers — the teenagers in the town — are grounded, more pedestrian. Their steps, performed mainly in sneakers, are rooted in hip-hop.

“The Prom” emphasizes those contrasting dance styles. “It’s traditional versus new, and that is the two sides,” Mr. Nicholaw said in an interview. “The musical comedy side and the more realistic side of things.”
