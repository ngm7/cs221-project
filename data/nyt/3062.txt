Ricardo Antonio Aguirre, a lawyer for Ms. Danner’s sister, said the settlement was reached Monday during mediation with the city. A court filing dated Wednesday said that an “agreement was reached on all issues.”

In a statement provided to The New York Times late Thursday, the New York City Law Department confirmed that the city had agreed to a settlement with Ms. Danner’s family.

“We carefully considered the facts impacting the civil claims against the city, including the criminal indictment of a responding officer and the disciplinary charges pending against him,” the statement said. “This agreement is a fair resolution of a tragic case and hopefully it brings some measure of relief to the family. The city is committed to preventing these tragedies from happening.”

Mr. Aguirre, who represents the woman’s sister, Jennifer Danner, called the settlement “fair.” Jennifer Danner, who sued the city for damages in January, “feels good about closure,” Mr. Aguirre added, though he said his client wanted Mayor de Blasio, Mr. O’Neill and other city officials to enhance training for patrol officers in dealing with emotionally disturbed people.

The New York Police Department has, in the meantime, filed internal disciplinary charges against Sergeant Barry, although a trial date has not been set. The charges accuse Sergeant Barry of failing to follow police procedure governing the use of force when dealing with emotionally disturbed individuals, according to legal documents. He is also accused of failing in his supervisory capacity.
