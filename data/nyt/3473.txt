LOS ANGELES — The ecstatically reviewed “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” stuck its landing, likely starting a new animated franchise for Sony Pictures. And Clint Eastwood, playing a cranky drug courier in “The Mule,” proved that he is still an incredibly bankable star, even at nearly 90 years old.

But it was a calamitous weekend at the North American box office for Peter Jackson, whose name did little for “Mortal Engines,” which arrived as one of the biggest flops of the year.

“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” heralded for its inventive animation and clever use of multiple Spideys, was the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada. It collected about $35.4 million at 3,813 theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Sony spent roughly $90 million to make the movie, not including substantial marketing costs. The PG-rated film was produced by a team that included Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the duo behind “The Lego Movie.”

Ticket buyers agreed with critics, giving “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” an A-plus grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
