Seasonal petits fours and chocolates from Valerie Confections in Los Angeles lend a touch of elegance to the holiday table. They include snowy little eggnog butter cakes scented with nutmeg, layered with bourbon ganache and iced with white chocolate adorned with gold leaf. Bittersweet chocolate, also decorated with gold leaf, encloses tender nougat. And mint-infused chocolate truffles sport wintry decorations.
