Should corporations be charged for crimes their employees commit?

That nettlesome question has come back to the fore as law enforcement authorities take aim at Goldman Sachs for its involvement in a vast scandal at a Malaysian investment fund.

The Malaysian government on Monday filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the bank of making false and misleading statements when it raised money for the fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The immediate consequences of the Malaysian charges against Goldman subsidiaries are likely to be limited, but the action will stir up discussion about how United States prosecutors should proceed and whether they should bring criminal charges against Goldman.

Where the investigations stand

So far, American prosecutors have secured a guilty plea from a former senior Goldman investment banker and filed money laundering and bribery charges against another former employee. It’s not clear what sort of action, if any, the Department of Justice will take against Goldman as a firm.
