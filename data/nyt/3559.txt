Those hungry for an end to sneaker mania will have to wait another year. Wandering Cassandras are foretelling the bubble’s burst, but it doesn’t look near. Some industry analysts said that designer sneakers were the No. 1 growth area for men’s and women’s footwear, and designers have not tired of making them.

At greater scale, name-brand sneakers still dominate. According to Josh Luber, the chief executive of StockX, a marketplace that connects sneaker buyers with sneaker resellers and tracks prices, the top sellers by volume and by market share on the platform were all Adidas Yeezys or Jordans.

But rounding out the top 10 was a more artisanal surprise: an Air Max 1/97 (a hybrid of the two Air Max styles) designed by Sean Wotherspoon, a vintage dealer and Nike collector.

“Typically, the top-selling sneakers on our platform are associated with big-name celebrities and athletes,” Mr. Luber said. Mr. Wotherspoon’s psychedelic pastel corduroy pair, which was solicited by Nike and was one of the winners of a fan vote to go into production, broke through thanks to “exceptional storytelling and design.”

The style was an immediate hit. After a limited initial release in November 2017 and a global one on Air Max Day in March of this year, it sold out. Until then, the average sale price for the original on StockX is $576 (they cost $160 when they were released). It was, in other words, a David win in a Goliath world, in a version of the story where David is bankrolled by Nike, a major corporation.
