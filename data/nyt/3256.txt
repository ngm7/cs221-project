As our December days fuse into an endless, unbroken night, we have one small solace: holiday lights. So beautiful, aren’t they? Glowing white lights adding a cheerful twinkle to the season.

When it comes to lighting up the world, who wouldn’t appreciate a frenetically blinking “Happy Holidays” message on a rural water tower? Who doesn’t enjoy gazing upon a plastic Nativity scene featuring Mary and Joseph with poorly painted eyes?

Meanies, that’s who. In this world of December darkness, it would be super petty if everyone judged each shining display. But holiday lights, like their owners, have personalities. Which display are you?
