ATLANTA — In the adolescent years of Major League Soccer, its championship game did not always feel like a spectacle. In those days, the M.L.S. Cup was held at neutral sites before most teams had fan bases willing to travel en masse, and the pockets of empty seats and the mosaic of random jerseys in the stadiums didn’t exactly create a sense of grandeur.

It would be hard to imagine a bigger contrast, then, with what is now being promised in Saturday night’s 23rd M.L.S. Cup, when the Portland Timbers will visit Atlanta United with the league title at stake. M.L.S., which stopped using neutral sites for its final after the 2011 game, could hardly have drawn up a better setting: the league’s two top teams — and its past two most valuable players — squaring off inside the year-old Mercedes-Benz Stadium, its stands packed with more than 70,000 fans wearing the colors of a brash, second-year team that has jolted the league with both its style of play and its next-generation (for M.L.S., at least) business model.

“It’s going to be incredible,” said Arthur Blank, who owns both Atlanta United and its gleaming new arena. “For our fans. Really, for soccer in North America.”

Adding to the atmosphere will be the fact that about 2,000 Timbers supporters are expected to be on hand as well, making them the largest traveling contingent for a final that many in the league can remember. Many of the Timbers supporters will have traveled from the opposite corner of the country this week, ready to give full-throated reminders to their hosts that they have been singing chants and winning games — and trophies — since before Atlanta United existed.
