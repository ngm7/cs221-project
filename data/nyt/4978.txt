Re “Abandoned America,” by Eduardo Porter (Sunday Review, Dec. 16):

Both my husband and I are Midwesterners by birth. I appreciate this thoughtful analysis of the difficulties facing rural America. However, I suggest that more attention be given to one of the basic problems facing rural regions: access. It is difficult to provide goods and services in these isolated areas. Attracting companies and new businesses is much more difficult because of their remoteness.

We have not lived in the Midwest for several years but have family members there. Visiting them from our home on the West Coast involves flying to Denver or Minneapolis, transferring to a regional carrier to take us to Sioux Falls, then renting a car to drive the remaining 150-plus miles to a small rural community in South Dakota. It takes the whole day to make this trip.

A century ago small rural towns were connected to the rest of the country by railroads. The loss of these connections has exacerbated the isolation. The access problem is not easily solved.

To the Editor:

Let ’s not gloss over the role that rural voters have played in their own demise. By being in blind thrall to backward-thinking right-wing Republican politics, rural communities have for years rejected the conditions that attract the high-tech new economy. Highly educated, highly skilled workers typically value cultural diversity over insularism; they value well-funded schools and libraries over mindless tax cuts; they value the rights and contributions of women and immigrants; they believe that science is not a liberal conspiracy.
