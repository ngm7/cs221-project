Though it remains unclear who recorded the call and how, it appears to have emerged from a long investigation by American officials into Jorge Cifuentes Villa, the leader of a Colombian trafficking clan, who said he started working with Mr. Guzmán a few years before his former Colombian connection was arrested.

Appearing at the trial as a witness for the government, Mr. Cifuentes in three days of testimony has described not only the various cocaine deals he hatched with the defendant in Ecuador, but also his own remarkable life of crime, which began when he was 4 and started helping his father move illegal cigarettes and whiskey through the port in Medellín.

On Tuesday, his first day on the stand, Mr. Cifuentes recalled how he met Mr. Guzmán in 2003 at a mescal-soaked party at the kingpin’s hide-out in the Sierra Madre mountains; it was a celebration of the second anniversary of his first escape from prison. Getting to the party required a harrowing landing on a steeply inclined covert airstrip. Once he was safely on the ground — and after he had said a few prayers — Mr. Cifuentes resolved, he told jurors, to buy Mr. Guzmán a helicopter so he could “fly in a more civilized way.”

That same year, he started sending Mr. Guzmán shipments of cocaine in carbon-fiber airplanes that were specially designed to frustrate radar. In 2007, after his brother — a former pilot for the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar — was killed, Mr. Cifuentes fled to Ecuador, where he began arranging drug deals with the FARC for Mr. Guzmán and protecting their investment by bribing a local military officer.

The officer was not the only person Mr. Cifuentes has acknowledged paying off. He testified that he routinely bribed the Ecuadorean Navy (for information about American naval ships) and the Colombian police (“whenever it was needed”). Early in his career, he told the jurors, he once paid off Colombian officials to expunge his prison record.
