It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information.

The death toll in Afghanistan dropped this week, with 50 deaths confirmed for pro-government forces and 14 for civilians.

The Afghan government carried out more than 160 airstrikes against insurgents in this period.
