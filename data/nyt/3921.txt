A few weeks ago, Jeremy Foster, a photographer, and Marikh Mathias, a model and former contestant on “The Bachelor,” were riding around Salt Lake City, looking for a place to do an Instagram photo shoot.

The mountains were a 10-minute drive away, but it was raining that day. A coffee shop is a reliable backdrop, but Mr. Foster finds them too crowded and overly photographed. Instead, the pair ended up at 4th Street Coin Laundry, where Ms. Mathias sat in an orange plastic chair and stood in high-heels and designer jeans in front of a Speed Queen commercial washing machine.

In their choice of setting, the photographer and model were right on trend. Yes, it seems your corner suds shop has become a strangely coveted location.
