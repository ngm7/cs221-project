VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Meng Wanzhou, a top executive of the Chinese technology company Huawei, was granted bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or about $7.5 million, while awaiting extradition to the United States from Canada, a judge ruled on Tuesday.

The decision came on the third day of a bail hearing for Ms. Meng, who is also a daughter of the Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, in a case that has complicated the relationship between China and the United States.

“I am satisfied that on the particular facts of this case, including the fact that Ms. Meng is a well-educated businesswoman who has no criminal record and of whom several people have attested to her good character, the risk of her non-attendance in court can be reduced to an acceptable level,” Justice William Ehrcke said in his ruling.

Ms. Meng and her husband will be responsible for a 7 million dollar cash deposit for bail, with the remaining 3 million dollars coming from her acquaintances. She will be released upon completion of court paperwork.
