Hi there! Here you are, rushing around with too many plans, not enough holiday shopping done and perhaps a mild headache from last night’s mulled wine. The least we can give you is a quick rundown of what’s going on in the business world. If you like what you’re reading and haven’t already subscribed, click here — and then forward to a friend if you’re feeling generous.

Speaking of the holiday season, are you one of the 45.7 million Americans planning to fly in the next two weeks? If so, keep an ear out: Customs officials at Kennedy Airport have intercepted almost 200 live finches (70 last week alone) that were smuggled on flights from Guyana. Once in the United States, the birds compete in chirping competitions, and a winner can fetch up to $10,000. While we do not condone any illegal behavior, in the grand scheme of sounds to be heard on a plane, a finch sounds downright pleasant.

A Bigger Apple in Your Backyard

Want a shot at an Apple employee discount? Now may be your moment. Apple announced plans on Thursday to invest $1 billion in a slick new campus in Austin, Tex. It will eventually bring 15,000 jobs to the area, while additional offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., each plan to hire more than 1,000 employees. For years, Apple has been under fire for relying heavily on China for its product manufacturing, and this announcement makes good on its recent promise to expand operations in the United States. Other tech giants like Amazon and Google have made similar moves to expand their domestic work force in the past few months.
