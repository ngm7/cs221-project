It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. Overnight tonight, on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, an American spacecraft called New Horizons will fly by and explore the most distant place ever visited: a small world called Ultima Thule.

Twenty-five hundred men and women across the United States worked to design and build New Horizons, its rocket and its nuclear power supply, and to launch it into space and to fly it across the solar system. In 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto. Now on Ultima’s doorstep, it is a mind-boggling four billion miles from Earth.

This spacecraft, this distant sentinel, is an amazing piece of American workmanship, operating essentially flawlessly in space for well over a decade, with no backup ship and with no second chance to visit any world it has explored.

Fifty years ago this week, during the Christmas holidays of 1968, another American spacecraft, Apollo 8, was launched and made the first voyage of humans to another world — our moon. In the half century since, we in the United States went on to send the first humans to walk the moon and to send robots to explore every planet known at the birth of the space age. This week, New Horizons will continue in that legacy of inquisitiveness, soft-power projection and pure scientific exploration.
