To the Editor:

Re “Chaos? A Trump Specialty,” by Michelle Cottle (Editorial Observer, Dec. 19):

Was it deference to the office occupied by Donald Trump that necessitated the “vaguely” qualifier to the description of his personality as “pugilistic, vaguely unhinged”? After nearly two years in office, Mr. Trump has given no indication that he deserves such a qualifier.
