The writers Bari Weiss and Eve Peyser were once internet adversaries. They still don’t agree about politics, but things changed once they met in real life. You can read their story here.

We are searching for people who have been at odds but are interested in finding common ground, in not demonizing people with different views, and maybe even in becoming something closer to friends than enemies.

Maybe you have a political nemesis whom you subtweet. Perhaps you have a Facebook foe. Or maybe your enemy is sitting across the campus library or in the cubicle next to you. If so, we’ve got a challenge for you: Invite that person to have a beer or coffee, or join you in a FaceTime chat. Tell us how it went.

Or maybe you’re a step ahead of us and you’ve already found a way to bridge the gap. We’d love to hear from you, too.
