It’s no secret that rents are on the rise, which means you get less space for the money. But if you’re feeling cramped, there may be another reason as well.

A recent study by RentCafe showed that the average size of a new rental apartment in the United States shrank more than 5 percent over the past decade, from 993 to 941 square feet. And the smallest apartments got even smaller: The average new studio shrank from 573 to 514 square feet, a decrease of more than 10 percent.

At the same time, the average rent went up, from $1,523 to $1,944 a month — an increase of nearly 28 percent.
