My own criminal days being well behind me, I could not speak to the real-life validity of the movie-world truism that professional hit men rarely live long enough to consider what to do once they reach retirement age. Particularly when aches and pains start interfering with the work.

Not too long into “Asher,” directed by Michael Caton-Jones and featuring Ron Perlman in the title hit man role, the hired killer has something that might be a heart attack while on the job.

The story of a delivery man for death reckoning with his own mortality could really be something. But “Asher” instead tries for the wistful and wise late-life romance. Asher, a former Mossad operative (or so it’s implied) who now operates out of a predominantly Jewish area of Brooklyn’s Williamsburg, is helped by Famke Janssen’s Sophie, who lives near Asher’s intended victim.
