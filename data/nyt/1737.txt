There is something strange rising in the Hudson River, the likes of which New York City, and the world, has never seen.

It’s green. It’s futuristic. It’s expensive.

It’s Diller Island, a park and performing arts venue being built on pilings over the Hudson River, along the West Side of Manhattan.

Known more formally as Pier 55, it is expected to open in spring 2021, and it will surely steal some of the spotlight from the nearby High Line, which has gained international renown and become one of the top tourist draws in New York City since opening in 2009.

Pier 55 has already drawn attention for its astronomical price tag — currently $250 million — that is being footed by the entertainment mogul Barry Diller and his wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.
