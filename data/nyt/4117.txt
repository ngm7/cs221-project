LONDON — The fiercely competitive sports media market in the United Kingdom is causing major problems for another insurgent company trying to penetrate it.

Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani’s Eleven Sports, a start-up network with global aspirations, is considering shutting down its business in Britain, just four months after arriving with a blaze of publicity and courting controversy.

Having spent millions to outbid the country’s biggest network for popular European soccer rights, Radrizzani said he is now likely to pull out of the country if he cannot work out distribution deals with Britain’s media giants for his channel, which until now has only been available online on a subscription basis.

Without the agreements, his business is not viable in the United Kingdom, Radrizzani said by phone this week. His channel had been dubbed locally as the “Netflix of sports,” a title that other so-called over-the-top platforms like the industry’s biggest spender, billionaire Len Blavatnick’s DAZN, has also been cultivating.
