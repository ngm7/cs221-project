Breast-feeding for longer than six months may lead to a smaller waist size for the mother, researchers report, and the effect persists for as long as a decade.

Their analysis, in The Journal of Womenâ€™s Health, used data on 678 women enrolled in two studies who were followed for an average of 11 years after giving birth.

Compared with women who breast-fed for less than six months, those who breast-fed longer had an average waist size about an inch and a half smaller.

It may be that women who breast-feed longer may be more health conscious in general than those who do not. But the researchers controlled for age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, blood pressure, smoking, diet quality, education, race and other health and behavioral characteristics.
