After Tuesday’s hearing, Mr. Murphy said little about Ms. Brennan’s testimony, including how his administration had responded to her accusations. Instead, in a statement, he praised her for the “leadership she showed in telling her story” and cited new state guidelines regarding sexual harassment and assault.

“She is right: no one should have to go through an ordeal to have their voices heard,” he said.

Ms. Brennan described on Tuesday how she repeatedly brought her account to top members of Mr. Murphy’s inner circle.

Ms. Brennan said that within days of being assaulted by Mr. Alvarez in her Jersey City apartment she met with Justin Braz, a friend who worked in state government and ended up working for Mr. Murphy’s campaign, and told him what had happened, though she did not ask him to inform others until Mr. Murphy’s transition.

She also went to the Jersey City police to report the assault, underwent a rape examination at a hospital and went to the Hudson County prosecutors office to press charges.

Despite seeing Mr. Alvarez continue to work for the Murphy campaign and later on the transition team, she decided to take a job in the Murphy administration because she was determined not to let the assault impact her career.

“As a victim of sex assault, I should not be the one to give up my career goals in favor of the career goals of my rapist,” said Ms. Brennan, who is chief of staff to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.

She recalled every instance that she crossed paths with Mr. Alvarez — at meetings, at a campaign rally with Mr. Murphy and President Obama, at a debate, at the governor’s inaugural ball.
