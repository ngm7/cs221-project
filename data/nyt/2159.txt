The novelist Rebecca Makkai was preparing for the usual string of interviews with radio stations and podcasts this year for her latest book, “The Great Believers.”

But then she got a call from her publicist, who told her to get ready for a more prominent appearance: on NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” “The biggest thing I’d done before that in terms of TV was a local morning show in Dayton, Ohio,” Ms. Makkai said.

Mr. Meyers has made it something of a habit to invite novelists onto his program, which averages 1.5 million viewers. In his nearly five years as host of “Late Night,” he has brought on a few dozen literary writers, many of them far from household names.

“As much as I love having Stephen King or Jonathan Franzen or George Saunders, we also saw it as an opportunity to have diverse writers and writers who are publishing their first or second novel, because this will probably mean more for them than people who are already established,” Mr. Meyers said in an interview.
