Mehdi Menouar, originally from Casablanca, Morocco , is a founder of Meska Sweets, created to share a taste of his homeland. His assorted cookies, classics like cornes de gazelle (gazelle horns or almond crescents), are traditional teatime treats, as are honey-sesame chebakia and a type of Moroccan macaron, though he innovates these with flavors like matcha. All are made in New Jersey; sold online by the piece, in boxes and assortments; and are gluten-free and kosher pareve.

Moroccan cookies and macarons, $2.25 to $135, meskasweets.com, 646-580-4960.
