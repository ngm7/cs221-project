The Mets addressed another one of the areas they targeted for improvement this off-season, reaching an agreement on Sunday with the two-time All-Star catcher Wilson Ramos.

The deal is for two years with $19 million guaranteed, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity because the contract was pending Ramos’s medical review. After that is complete, the Mets may introduce Ramos, 31, at a news conference later this week.

In this active first winter under the new general manager Brodie Van Wagenen, the Mets explored several options for upgrading at catcher — notably exploring a trade for J. T. Realmuto, an All-Star for the Miami Marlins. Like many teams, the Mets loved Realmuto’s all-around ability and age (27), but they found the asking price to be too high.

They also considered free agents such as Martin Maldonado, a light-hitting defensive catcher, and Yasmani Grandal, a more well-rounded player. But Grandal would cost more in dollars to sign — not including the compensatory draft pick and international bonus money that would go to the Los Angeles Dodgers because he rejected their $17.9 million qualifying offer.
