When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it.

Corbin, the top pitcher on the market, did not sign with the two suitors close to his hometown in upstate New York: the Philadelphia Phillies, whose owner was prepared to spend “stupid” money over the winter, and the Yankees, who have written the book on it.

Instead, the Washington Nationals landed Corbin, a 29-year-old left-hander.

The Nationals were flush with cash — the expiring contracts of Bryce Harper, Daniel Murphy, Gio Gonzalez and Matt Wieters free nearly $62 million from their payroll — and probably fueled by last season’s collapse, they were willing to outbid the competition by adding a sixth year to the offer.

Corbin, for his part, also gave a little, allowing the Nationals, as is their habit, to defer some of the money, according to a baseball official familiar with the agreement.
