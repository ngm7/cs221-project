THURSDAY PUZZLE — When you first open your newspaper or your app to the crossword puzzle, do you examine it, or do you dive right in? Do you cast suspicious glances at the grid or pore over the list of clues, or do you start scribbling right away?

It’s always a good idea to eyeball the grid before you get started because it can tell you something about what you’re about to solve. The first thing you might have noticed about John Westwig’s third New York Times grid was that there were four unchecked squares. For those of you just joining us, one rule of American-style crossword puzzle making is that each square should be checked, or be part of both an Across and a Down entry.

Before you noted the unchecked squares, perhaps you noticed the large X shaped pattern of the black squares. The pattern reminds you more of a Saturday grid, doesn’t it?

An unchecked square, much less four of them, plus the X should be enough to alert you to the fact that something is up.
