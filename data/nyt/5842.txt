To the Editor:

A Dec. 18 news article about a speech Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo gave in Manhattan says Mr. Cuomo “repeated his calls for the introduction of automatic voter registration, voting by mail and early voting, and he suggested that Election Day become a state holiday. ”

Governor Cuomo should be applauded for embracing a series of pro-democracy reforms that would greatly protect and expand New Yorkers' right to vote and restore the public's faith in our state government.

In November, some six million New Yorkers voted, but millions more did not, under our state’s regressive voting laws, which depress voter participation. In the 2016 presidential election, in states that actively encouraged voter participation — like Maine and Minnesota — turnout rates exceeded 70 percent, compared with New York, where the turnout rate failed to break 50 percent.

The long-overdue election proposals Mr. Cuomo discussed, along with the necessary changes to our campaign finance system, should enjoy strong support from legislators in both parties. They should move swiftly in the new year to pass legislation that will revitalize democracy here in New York State.
