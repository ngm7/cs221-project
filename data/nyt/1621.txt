Q: Three months after I finished renovating the kitchen in my Queens co-op, the vice president of the board saw pictures I’d posted on my Instagram page, which led him to question the scope of work described in my renovation package. As a result, management reinspected my apartment even though the work had been inspected three times during demolition and renovation. Now they want me to hire an engineer — for a $700 fee — to confirm that I didn’t compromise the structure of the building. Do they have a right to reinspect my apartment and make these demands based on images seen on social media?

A: Post photos of your holiday party on Instagram and you have to assume that the people you didn’t invite will find out about all the fun they missed. The same goes for photos of your new kitchen — you may have posted them for your friends to admire, but other people are watching, too.

“If somebody wants to post something on an Instagram page that’s open to people and it exposes a potential problem, too bad for them,” said Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan firm Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas.

Review the alteration agreement you signed with your co-op board, which likely gave the board wide latitude over your renovation. Most agreements specify that a shareholder cannot deviate from the approved plans, and they give boards the right to inspect without notice when workers are in the apartment and within a reasonable period after the work is completed, Mr. Sladkus said.
