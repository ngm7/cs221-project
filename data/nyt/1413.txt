LONDON — Two former executives at the supermarket chain Tesco have been acquitted of fraud and false accounting charges after a judge ruled there was not enough evidence for a jury to consider the case against them.

The executives, Christopher Bush, who led Tesco’s British division, and John Scouler, an executive in the same unit, had been charged by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office after a 2014 investigation into accounting irregularities at the grocery chain.

“While I am delighted that my innocence has finally been established, it is troubling that Mr. Scouler and I were ever charged,” Mr. Bush said in a statement. “Put simply, these charges should never have been brought, and serious questions should be asked about the way in which the S.F.O. has conducted this investigation.”

In an emailed statement, the law firm representing Mr. Scouler offered a similar response.

“We have long argued that the S.F.O.’s prosecution of Mr. Scouler was fundamentally flawed, that he should not have been charged and that the S.F.O. should not have proceeded with this trial,” the firm, BCL Solicitors, said in the statement.
