The police fatally shot a man holding a 14-inch knife and an officer was shot in the stomach while responding to a report of a domestic dispute on Staten Island on Sunday night, the authorities said.

The police received a 911 call shortly before 10 p.m. about a drunk man with a knife at 30 Bridge Court, near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Two officers responded and ordered the man to drop the knife, the police said.

The man refused and came toward them with it in his hand, the police said.

“Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me,” the man told them, according to Dermot F. Shea, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department.

At least one officer fired a stun gun at him but it did not stop him, Chief Shea said. Then the police started shooting, firing at least 10 bullets, he said.
