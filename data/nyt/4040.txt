What’s eating American C.E.O.s?

We have some insight, thanks to the Yale C.E.O. Summit with Jeffrey Sonnenfeld last week in New York. The event was strictly off the record, but DealBook has the results of a survey of 134 business leaders who were there:

President Trump. Three in four C.E.O.s said they often apologized to their international business partners about the president’s messages. Eighty-seven percent said Mr. Trump’s negotiating style had cost the nation the trust of its allies, and three-quarters felt he wasn’t leading effectively on issues critical to U.S. national security.

Trade and Huawei. Just over three-quarters said it was appropriate for Canada to arrest Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of the Chinese tech giant Huawei. But just one in five supported the idea of President Trump intervening in the case. Three-fifths said the issues surrounding Huawei and Ms. Meng would affect trade tensions, and just under half said that they could affect future travel plans.

A recession. Almost half of the respondents thought the U.S. could wind up in a recession by the end of 2019. The greatest threats to U.S. markets, 67 percent said, are U.S. political instability and trade negotiations.

Tech regulation. An overwhelming message here: 90 percent of respondents said technology companies needed to be regulated more closely.
