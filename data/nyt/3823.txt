Mr. Trudeau was kind enough to write an explainer for his puzzle as his constructor notes, so I am going to turn this over to him. He examines his theme and then answers his own questions for you.

If you identify as L.G.B.T., a P.O.C. or non-male and you would like to get into crossword constructing, I’d be thrilled to offer whatever mentorship and wisdom I can to help you get your puzzles published. Contact me on Instagram: @rosstrudeau.

Jeff Chen is the master of giving quick lessons to aspiring constructors, so I’ll use this note to try to do the same. Here’s a breakdown of what I think makes this theme set “tight” and “snappy.”

Revealer: FASHION POLICE

Is it a lively phrase? I think so. Thanks, Mom!

Can it be reinterpreted or re-parsed to make new meaning? Yes. And I love revealers that reverse this convention. In other words, they take a nonliteral colloquialism and turn it more literal.

Is this new meaning unexpected and/or humorous? I think so. I’m imagining the chief chastising her sergeants for not wearing the right clothes on their beat. (My original clue suggested FASHION POLICE were people who determine the theme answers, rather than the wearers.)

Theme Answers: DUST JACKET, TRAIL BLAZER, HOLDING TANK, FOLLOW SUIT

Are they lively phrases? I think so. FOLLOW SUIT is not that sparkly. But there are uncommon letters in other entries (J, Z), which is a bonus.

Are they ALL two-word phrases? Check.

Can the second word in ALL phrases denote a piece of clothing? Check.

Do ALL phrases regularly denote something that is not a piece of clothing? Check.

Do ALL of the first words describe common POLICE activities? Police FOLLOW suspects, they HOLD perps; they DUST for prints; and they look for TRAILs of clues. (You’ll notice that some of these activities are nouns and some are verbs. An even tighter theme set would use only one or the other.)
