With eight different women winning the last eight Grand Slam events, women’s tennis has rarely been so unpredictable. The off-season did little to calm the turbulence, with many top players making changes to their coaching arrangements as they prepare for the 2019 season.

Top-ranked Simona Halep and Darren Cahill ended their partnership. No. 2 Angelique Kerber is no longer working with Wim Fissette. No. 6 Sloane Stephens is currently “on a break” from her coach Kamau Murray, he said.

The longest coach-player relationship to end in the off-season was Venus Williams’s with David Witt, who had been part of her team full-time for 11 years. After starting as a hitting partner, Witt became a trusted member of the tight-knit Williams team, and took on a larger role as the family patriarch Richard Williams stepped back from the rigors of the tour.

In an interview, Witt called the separation “a total surprise,” saying that he had been planning his travel to Williams’s planned first tournament of the season in Auckland, New Zealand, before she ended the partnership in a phone call last month.
