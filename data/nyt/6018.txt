MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Let’s consider for a moment what could have been.

A prizefight of a college football game, with the No. 1 ranked offense (Oklahoma) slugging it out with the No. 2 offense (Alabama) nearly score for score in a College Football Playoff semifinal that would send the winner to the national championship game on Jan. 7.

That was true of the second half of the Orange Bowl on Saturday, played at Hard Rock Stadium, in which Oklahoma outscored Alabama, 24-14.

But that’s not what the scoreboard said at the end. It read 45-34 in Alabama’s favor, sending the Tide rolling to the national championship game for the fourth consecutive season, this time against Clemson in a rematch of the 2017 title match that Alabama lost to the Tigers.

But, oh, to replay that second half and realize that Oklahoma had a formula good enough to go toe-to-toe with Alabama, if only it could have gotten a head of steam from the start. What the final score doesn’t tell you is that Alabama led, 28-0, in the first half.
