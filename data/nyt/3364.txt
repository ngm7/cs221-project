The Rams were already behind by 10 on Sunday night when Jared Goff dropped back, looking to get his team back into a game against an Eagles squad it was expected to dominate. Instead, he stumbled, dropped the ball, gathered himself briefly and then threw an interception.

It was a play that perfectly summed up the Rams’ performance for most of Sunday’s game, as Los Angeles looked thoroughly outclassed at home in a 30-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, a matchup they had entered as double-digit favorites.

It was the second consecutive loss for the Rams (11-3), who have gone from being 9-0 with home-field advantage in the playoffs a virtual lock to hoping they can hold off the Chicago Bears to keep their first-round bye. The Eagles (7-7) kept the smallest sliver of hope of overtaking Dallas in the N.F.C. East, and they remain very much alive for a wild-card berth as they trail Minnesota by just percentage points for the conference’s final playoff spot.
