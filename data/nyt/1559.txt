Albert Frère, a Belgian high school dropout who parlayed the profits from his father’s nail factory into a fortune worth billions, and whose multinational mergers and acquisitions helped solidify the economic integration of Europe, died on Dec. 3 in Gerpinnes, Belgium. He was 92.

His death was announced by Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the holding company that he and Paul Desmarais, a Canadian entrepreneur, bought in 1982 to manage their investments.

Mr. Frère, who was named a baron by King Albert II of Belgium in 1994, knew no borders as he bought and sold major stakes in blue-chip conglomerates. Those conglomerates also ignored national boundaries in Europe as they merged with other companies or acquired them.

After buying a stake in the Belgian oil company Petrofina, for example, Mr. Frère later sold it to a French competitor, Total.
