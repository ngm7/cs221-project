Carla Hall, the vivacious television celebrity and restaurateur, covers all bases in her latest book, showcasing Southern-inflected recipes pegged for “everyday” or “celebration” with plenty of overlap. For those seeking New Year’s inspiration, her book has plenty to offer, like black-eyed peas (considered lucky) in hummus, in a salad and in a vinaigrette sauce for pork. For dessert, as 2019 dawns, I’d head straight for the custardy nutmeg eggnog buttermilk pie or the gingerbread layer cake.

“Carla Hall’s Soul Food: Everyday and Celebration” by Carla Hall, with Genevieve Ko (Harper Wave, $29.99).
