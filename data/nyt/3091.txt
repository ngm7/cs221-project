A police officer shot a man in the Bronx on Wednesday night after the man opened fire and critically wounded another person — then pointed a gun at officers, the authorities said.

Officers responded to White Plains Road and Cranford Avenue around 7:50 p.m. when they heard three to five gunshots, Rodney Harrison, the New York Police Department’s Chief of Patrol Services, said at a news conference.

The officers determined that there had been a dispute between two men, in which of one of the men shot the other in the arm.

As the officers pursued the gunman, Chief Harrison said, the man pointed a silver firearm at the officers but did not fire. An officer then fired one round at the gunman, striking him in the torso, Chief Harrison said.
