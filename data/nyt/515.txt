When it comes to decorating for the holidays, few things are easier, yet more transformative, than hanging a wreath.

“I think nothing is friendlier than putting a wreath on your door,” said Carolyne Roehm, the lifestyle author and tastemaker. “Maybe I’m just very hokey, but it’s so welcoming, and gives me a sense of warmth.”

Perhaps that explains why she rarely limits herself to just one.

“I put them everyplace,” said Ms. Roehm, whose latest book, “Design & Style: A Constant Thread,” was published by Rizzoli this fall. “I put them on my doors, some of my mantels and in windows. Years ago, I hung them from the ceiling like a chandelier.”

And over time, she has experimented with a variety of materials. “I’ve gone from doing them in the traditional pine, balsam and fir, and adding juniper branches and berries,” she said, “to pine cones” — both natural and golden. “I’ve done them in real fruit. I’ve done them in fake fruit. I’ve done them in flowers.”
