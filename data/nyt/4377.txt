WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The constructor Seth A. Abel, whose name neatly anagrams to “beats heal” despite his choice in his notes below, has returned after a fairly long hiatus to bring us a puzzle about ... well, you’ll see.

Tricky Clues

18A: I had to think about this one, and then it suddenly hit me in such a way that I laughed out loud. “Ahab’s inspiration?” sounds like we’re looking for what motivated the “Moby Dick” captain, but with an answer like SEA AIR, that can’t be right. But if you look at the word “inspiration” as inhaling, the answer suddenly becomes a lot clearer. Nice wordplay there.

1D: “ Ones always tossing things back?” is not necessarily about a game of catch; here we are thinking about bending the elbow, so to speak, and the answer is SOTS.

55D: An interesting variant on “An apt name for ...” clues. “Average guy?” is NORM because that’s a synonym for average.
