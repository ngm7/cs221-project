To the Editor:

Re “The Hypocrisy of Hanukkah” (Sunday Review, Dec. 2):

Michael David Lukas’s essay concerns the hypocrisy of observing a holiday that, if modern scholarship is to be trusted, pitted Jew against Jew in deadly violence fomented by fundamentalist crazies. If this is true, then why ever would we continue to retell this horror, nay, to celebrate it?

I assume that Mr. Lukas and his family also celebrate Thanksgiving, Valentine’s Day and Halloween. All these observances have their roots in violence and fundamentalism. Being human, over time we reimagine and ennoble historic events. If purists drop the observance of all holidays that have a murky history, then all they may be left with is birthday cake.

Yet, as Mr. Lukas also reminds us, whatever its “real” roots, Hanukkah celebrates the possibility of light in dark times, and the importance of even small miracles. It also underscores the destiny and vision of a people who have spent more than three millenniums reminding the world to leave the corners of our fields untouched for the poor and the stranger to glean.

And Hanukkah is here as well for this: to fight (yes, fight if need be) in order to live where we can celebrate it, or Christmas, or both, or neither. That’s why I light the candles, sing the songs, eat the potato latkes (and ours aren’t greasy) and then help my neighbor down the street decorate the Christmas tree.
