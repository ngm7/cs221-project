A CMT special brings very American music to a very American place. And Ben Stiller wears braces in “There’s Something About Mary.”

What’s on TV

2018 AMERICANAFEST 9 p.m. on CMT. Performing in Nashville at the Ryman Auditorium, sometimes called the Mother Church of Country Music, became a mile marker for country music singers on the rise in the 1940s, when the auditorium began its decades-long tenure as home of the country music radio program the “Grand Ole Opry” and wove itself into the fabric of Americana. This special, filmed at the Ryman in September during CMT’s Americana Honors and Awards ceremony, has performances from American stars old and new: Rosanne Cash performs a song from her latest album, “She Remembers Everything,” which was well received when it was released in October. Also on the bill are the alt-country singer Brandi Carlile and the more recently minted star Margo Price. The program extends beyond country, with the venerable blues guitarist Buddy Guy performing, along with the genre-straddling blues and R&B singer Fantastic Negrito and the Southern rock singer Jason Isbell and others.
