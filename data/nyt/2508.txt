A former police detective in Illinois joined the Drug Enforcement Administration to help a gang of drug dealers in Puerto Rico and provided the gang with weapons and distributed drugs over a decade, the authorities said in an indictment on Tuesday.

The D.E.A. agent, Fernando Gomez, was charged with narcotics conspiracy and use and possession of firearms. Prosecutors said he obtained firearms from drug dealers while he was working for the Evanston Police Department and sent them to Puerto Rico, where they were provided to a co-conspirator in the gang, according to a superseding indictment announced by the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York.

Mr. Gomez, 41, then joined the D.E.A. “so that he could help members of the narcotics conspiracy” to “evade prosecution by law enforcement,” the prosecutors’ statement said.

The charges relate to a 10-year period from about 2006 to 2016. Mr. Gomez worked for the Evanston Police Department from 2004 to 2010 before joining the D.E.A. in 2011, according to Perry J. Polinski, a spokesman for the Evanston police.
