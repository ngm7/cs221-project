UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The Islanders came home on Saturday night, to the arena on Long Island where they played for 43 seasons before moving to Brooklyn three years ago, and fans celebrated in the most appropriate way possible: with a tailgate and a raucous comeback victory.

“I have been a fan since I was in the Cub Scouts, “ said Leon Bassen, 34, of Lindenhurst, who was enjoying the scene in the parking lot of Nassau Coliseum with friends, hours before the puck dropped for the game, which the Islanders rallied to win, 3-2, over the Columbus Blue Jackets.

“Going to Barclays Center, you feel like a stranger in someone’s house,” Bassen said. “Here, even before you walk in that building, you’re home.”

The Islanders announced in January that the team would split this season’s home schedule between Barclays Center in Brooklyn — where they moved at the start of the 2015-16 season — and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale. The plan is for the team to move to a not-yet-built modern arena at Belmont Park, previously known for horse racing, for the 2021-22 season.
