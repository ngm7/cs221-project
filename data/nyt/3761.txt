Indoors: Both a conventional staircase and a private elevator lead to an oval foyer with diamond-patterned marble floors and walls hung with murals adapted from 18th-century etchings. At one end is a dining room with an open, beamed ceiling and multiple sets of French doors leading to a stone terrace. Beyond the dining room to the left is a living room with a gas fireplace that has a black marble surround. The fireplace’s herringbone pattern echoes that of the pickled hardwood floors.

The dining room opens on the right to a kitchen with black marble countertops and professional culinary appliances, including a Wolf range. The area has a breakfast room and a butler’s pantry that leads to what the owners describe as a cabinet of curiosities: a room with floor-to-ceiling glass display cases. Doors with English brass hardware open to a powder room and a coatroom.

Nearby is a room that could be used as a study or bedroom (it has a private three-quarter bathroom). The master and guest bedrooms are in a wing at the opposite end of the foyer. The master suite connects to a bathroom with a walk-in shower and a separate tiled tub. The guest suite has a bathroom with mosaic tile, a walk-in shower and a vessel sink on a pedestal. There is also a laundry room.
