HONG KONG — Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs on Monday, accusing the giant Wall Street bank of making false and misleading statements.

The charges are a rare international rebuke of an institution that has long represented the pinnacle of money and power. The 149-year-old investment bank already faces mounting pressure in the United States, where two former bankers face charges of bribery and money laundering related to its business in Malaysia.

The Malaysian authorities also charged several individuals in connection with the multibillion-dollar international fraud scandal that ensnared Goldman and that led to the ouster of Malaysia’s former prime minister, Najib Razak. The government said it would seek criminal fines in excess of $2.7 billion related to the charges.

Goldman is cooperating with the authorities in both countries, Edward Naylor, a Goldman spokesman in Asia, said in an emailed statement. “We believe these charges are misdirected, will vigorously defend them and look forward to the opportunity to present our case,” he said.
