What’s on TV

READY PLAYER ONE (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. Based on Ernest Cline’s 2011 sci-fi novel, Steven Spielberg’s adaptation explores a dystopia in the year 2045 where citizens escape into a Virtual Reality paradise known as the Oasis. When its co-creator dies, he leaves behind a digital Easter egg, granting ownership of the virtual world to the first who can hunt it down. The box-office hit follows a teenager, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), and a crew of egg hunters, or “gunters,” on their quest to find the egg before a corporation, IOI, can claim ownership.
