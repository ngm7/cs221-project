What were you thinking?

The academy asked me to do it. I was young and naïve, and I thought, “Well, it’s the academy, they must know what’s best.” I was also a huge fan of [the Oscar-winning composer] Marvin Hamlisch, who wrote the number, so I figured he would be writing something great.

At what point did you know the number was tanking?

I remember vividly looking out in the audience and seeing Barry Levinson, who on that particular evening was the belle of the ball with “Rain Man,” and I could see him very clearly popeyed and mouthing, “what the [expletive]?” But to be a successful actor, you have to have a big dollop of self-denial, so I managed to convince myself that I’d killed it.

What was the reaction like backstage?

I got to the green room and Lucille Ball told me she didn’t know I was such a good singer and made me sit next to her and hold her hand and watch the next 20 minutes of the Oscars. That ended up being my all-time favorite memory because a lot of people didn’t like it, but Lucy did. If it made Lucy happy, it made me happy, because I love Lucy.

When did you realize this was becoming a national controversy?

One thing people forget about this whole thing is the academy for some reason decided they didn’t need to license Snow White. Disney threatened to sue, and when that got into the press, there was a revisionist blowback. When people really examined the number, they saw it for what a disaster it was.

Why do you think people got so upset?

I made a huge mistake. I had always thought the Oscars were a bit of fun escapism for America where we celebrate and honor the craft of making movies. What I didn’t realize was the grand solemnity and profound seriousness and the contribution to society at large that the evening represents to a lot of people, and that’s on me. That’s my bad.
