VARIETY PUZZLE — Caitlin Lovinger writes the weekend columns while I am off doing other puzzly things, so it has been a while since I’ve solved an acrostic. I had forgotten how much fun they are, and how satisfying it is to toggle back and forth from solving the clues to guessing the words from the filled-in letter patterns in the quote. My pre-New Year’s resolution is to get back into solving these, just for fun.

I walked into today’s puzzle — that’s a hint, but not a spoiler — with Q’s “1982 Sydney Pollack comedy,” the classic “TOOTSIE.” Next up for me was MAE WEST’s quote, “I like restraint, if it doesn’t go too far.” ETSY was another gimme for me, as I just bought a buffet table from a furniture reseller on the site.

Clue C’s BAY LEAF tripped me up; I had PARSLEY at first. And I had to run the alphabet in my head to remember that the typewriter brand in clue T was OLIVETTI.

That should be enough of a leg up to get those of you who are still solving through the puzzle. But hang in there, because ROBERT MACFARLANE’S quote is one that will leave you thinking.
