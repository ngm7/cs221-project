WASHINGTON â€” House lawmakers on Monday filed a two-week stopgap spending bill that would ensure that the government remains fully funded as the nation mourns former President George Bush this week.

The measure, which includes funding for the Homeland Security and Interior Departments and other federal agencies, would push a showdown over funding for a wall on the southern border to Dec. 21, just before Christmas. It is expected to be passed by unanimous consent this week, according to people familiar with the talks.

President Trump has signaled that he will sign a short-term measure that does not contain wall funding, but has repeatedly threatened to shut down parts of the government if Democrats do not give him the wall money he has demanded.
