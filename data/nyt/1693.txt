Name: Kimberly Drew

Age: 28

Hometown: Orange, N.J.

Now lives: In a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, with a roommate.

Claim to fame: Ms. Drew is an art curator, writer and social activist, who spent three years as the social media manager for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she was “responsible for building an imprint within the social sphere,” she said.

Big break: As an undergraduate at Smith College, Ms. Drew studied art history with a concentration in museum studies. That led to an internship at the Studio Museum in Harlem, where Ms. Drew said she found her true calling.

In 2011, while she was a junior, she started a Tumblr blog called Black Contemporary Art, as a place to follow art by and about people of African descent. “At the time I had one of the sole Tumblr art blogs that was for black art and black culture, and so people were really attracted to it,” she said. “It just sort of took off.”
