Widespread anger in Georgia over a voting system that Democrats believed to be rigged against them was not enough to prevent a Republican candidate from winning a runoff on Tuesday for secretary of state, the chief overseer of the state’s elections.

Brad Raffensperger, an engineer from the Atlanta suburbs and a member of the State House, defeated John Barrow, a Democrat who supported overhauling the election system that some in his party said had helped Republicans “steal” the closely fought Georgia governor’s race last month.

The Associated Press declared Mr. Raffensperger the winner at about 10:20 p.m. Eastern Time. Uncertified tallies at 11 p.m. showed Mr. Raffensperger with about 53 percent of the vote in the runoff, compared with 47 percent for Mr. Barrow.

Mr. Raffensperger, 63, largely supported the status quo in Georgia’s election system, and said during the campaign that he was running for secretary of state “to make sure that only American citizens are voting in our elections.”
