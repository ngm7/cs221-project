In “One Good Meal,” we ask cooking-inclined creative people to share the story behind a favorite dish they actually make and eat at home on a regular basis — and not just when they’re trying to impress.

When the New York-based cookware brand Great Jones launched in November, it sold what had been projected as a month’s worth of pots and pans in the first two days. Part of the appeal was the affordable price — the entire five-piece set costs $395 — and part was the stylish aesthetic, with Dutch ovens coming in broccoli green, mustard yellow and macaron pink. “There are a lot of fashion influences in the color,” says the brand’s 28-year-old co-founder Sierra Tishgart. “We wanted the stainless pieces to look like jewelry. A Celine bag informs the shade of our blue.”

As Tishgart entered the holiday season, she began using her line’s Deep Cut — a cross between a skillet and a sauté pan — to make her mother’s kugel, the Jewish noodle casserole she ate every year as a girl growing up in Philadelphia. “There’s a cup of sugar in the recipe,” Tishgart says. “When she put it down on the table, whether it was for Thanksgiving or a Hanukkah meal, it was always part of the savory course. As a kid, it was the best thing ever because it was like getting to eat dessert before dessert.”
