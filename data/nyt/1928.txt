It came to this: The Washington Redskins on Sunday started Mark Sanchez at quarterback.

As one could have predicted, Sanchez played forgettably and was benched in the second half. So who did the Redskins replace him with? A quarterback who had not thrown a pass since 2011, and whose last employer was the San Diego Fleet.

It has been a trying year for Redskins quarterbacks. Last season, Kirk Cousins was reasonably proficient in leading Washington to a 7-9 record. But wanting a little bit of an upgrade, the Redskins traded in the off-season for Alex Smith of the Chiefs, a team that had Patrick Mahomes ready to take his job.

Smith guided this Redskins team to a 6-4 start, good enough to lead the weak N.F.C. East. After 10 games, The New York Times Playoff Simulator gave Washington a 65 percent chance to make the postseason.

But Smith sustained an ugly broken leg, forcing the team to turn to the journeyman Colt McCoy. Then McCoy broke his leg, too. So, the Redskins went out and signed Sanchez.
