As far as Bogotá neighborhoods go, Quinta Camacho is small — about six square blocks. But a wave of new establishments in recent years has made this quiet pocket in the sprawling and hectic metropolis worth exploring. The centrally located enclave is known for its brick, Tudor-style houses built in the 1940s and ’50s. While the exteriors of these charming structures with shingled roofs have been protected from alterations by the city, their interiors are being transformed into restaurants, bars, boutiques and even a stylish hotel. Travelers often overlook the tiny area, but they shouldn’t. As you walk around, it feels like a buzzy, European village — different from anything else you’ll find in Colombia’s capital.

1. Casa Legado

This bright, year-old boutique property feels more like home than a hotel. Its seven rooms are individually decorated based on personalities of the family members of its owner, local interior designer Helena Dávila; take the Luisa, a cheery room with tropical print wallpaper named for her young niece. The hotel’s cozy living room has puzzles and games, breakfast is served at a communal farmhouse-style table, and the kitchen fridge is stocked with snacks and drinks that guests can take as they please.
