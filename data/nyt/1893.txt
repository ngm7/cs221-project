Except it did on Sunday, when Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill threw to wide receiver Kenny Stills, who caught the football over the middle at his own 45. Stills, who was surrounded by three Patriots, held the ball briefly before pitching it to DeVante Parker.

Parker flipped the ball to running back Kenyan Drake, who snatched it with two Patriots defenders within an arm’s length of him. But neither Patriot could get Drake on the ground.

In fact, he was barely touched as he sliced through the rest of the New England defense. Most comically, the Patriots’ 6-foot-6 tight end Rob Gronkowski, who was probably on the field to bat down an anticipated Hail Mary, had the last good chance to stop Drake. Gronkowski instead chose the wrong angle to chase him, and with lumbering strides he clumsily missed the tackle and stumbled to the turf.

Drake’s 69-yard touchdown gave Miami a 34-33 victory and was the longest play from scrimmage to win a game with no time remaining in the fourth quarter since the N.F.L.-American Football League merger in 1970.

“It came down to one play,” Belichick said, “But there were a lot of things besides that.”

Belichick said that the Patriots, like all teams, practiced how to defend the multiple lateral, end-of-the-game play.

“Unfortunately, we didn’t do a good job on it today,” he said. “That’s not what we want to do. In the end, they made one more play than we did.”

Gronkowski said afterward, “I’ve never really been a part of anything like that.”

The loss dropped the Patriots to 9-4, and they will now need help from others if they want to be assured home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Five of the last seven A.F.C. championship games have been hosted by New England, including the last two.
