To the Editor:

“Here Is What Parents of Addicted Children Can Do” (news article, Dec. 19) depicted what life is like for young people addicted to nicotine.

In May, I created a video titled “Juulers Against Juul” that debuted on “Good Morning America.” The video looks at my friends struggling with nicotine addiction. They discuss why they first started using Juul, how it disrupts their studies and why they are unable to quit.

These friends of mine do not want to Juul. However, as your article explains, they can’t help it. Nicotine is insidious like that — it can hijack a young person’s life.

We can stop this. How? Ban the flavors. Youths cite flavors as the reason for their use, with 81.5 percent of young e-cigarette users saying they used the product because it “comes in flavors I like .”
