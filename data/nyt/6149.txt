But the biggest party in the city isn’t for the faint of heart. It requires dressing for the weather, arriving early and, perhaps, rationing liquids (no portable toilets). Problematically this year, umbrellas are forbidden.

Where’s the ball: Atop 1 Times Square, Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets.

Who designed it: Waterford Crystal, led by a master artisan from a small Irish town.

Where to watch: The ball can “best be seen along Broadway, from 43rd Street to 50th Street, and along Seventh Avenue, as far north as 59th Street,” according to the Times Square Alliance.

When to arrive: “Prime viewing areas may fill up early in the afternoon,” the alliance says.

How many people will join you: The alliance says around a million, though that figure is often disputed.

Vehicular traffic: Banned around 3 p.m.

How much are tickets? There are no tickets. It’s first come first served.
