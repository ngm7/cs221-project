Re “Thirst for Oil Threatens a Pristine Arctic Refuge” (front page, Dec. 3):

The Trump administration’s hard push to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is horrific. This news comes days after the release of our National Climate Assessment , which verified again that the combustion of fossil fuels causes climate change. Now we scramble to drill in a very fragile place.

Climate change is seriously affecting Alaska and the Arctic region. The temperature has gone up noticeably in the Arctic, and the ice is melting. So we choose to extract even more oil from that area!

Alaska is interesting in that it levies no taxes , and the state’s economy is largely based on oil, a dangerous fossil fuel. So the state needs to produce a dangerous product, whose global use is coming to an end, to make ends meet.

The irony is sad. It involves oil tycoons who see dollar signs, politicians who seek power, Alaskan natives who wish to preserve their culture and a precious wild place. I feel overwhelmed.
