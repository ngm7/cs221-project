LONDON — Five Russian biathletes and five officials with the Russian national team are the subject of an investigation into doping and corruption-related offenses, the Austrian authorities told the team on a visit to its hotel Wednesday.

The case is related to a World Cup event in Hochfilzen, Austria, last year, and comes during a wider criminal investigation into doping and corruption involving the International Biathlon Union, which is based in Salzburg. The organization’s longtime president, Anders Besseberg, resigned this year shortly after a raid on the union’s headquarters after prosecutors claimed that up to $300,000 had been paid to cover up doping infringements they said were carried out by Russian athletes.

The revelation that Austrian investigators are investigating the Russian athletes and officials comes at a sensitive time as a deadline for the Russian authorities to hand over critical laboratory data to the World Anti-Doping Agency draws near. WADA says the data is critical to identifying the athletes who participated in a yearslong state-supported cheating scheme unmasked more than two years ago.

Doping is a criminal offense in Austria. The state attorney’s office for the prosecution of economic offenses and corruption informed the “accused persons” of its investigation at their hotel in Hochfilzen, where they were staying for this week’s World Cup event. None of the accused have been interviewed, it said.
