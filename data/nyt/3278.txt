After a bit of brawling and a spate of North Pole deaths, after the Candy Cane of the Apocalypse is unsheathed to ward off evil, the lamb with seven horns and seven eyes is borne aloft by a malevolent ghost.

End times? Christmastime? Both, actually, in Greg Kotis’s “The Truth About Santa,” a cheerily warped holiday sendup whose sardonic sense of humor can’t hide its gooey heart — though it would amp up the festivities if this revival, directed by Ilana Becker at the Tank, were less susceptible to sentiment.

Mr. Kotis, a Tony Award winner for the book and lyrics of the satirical “Urinetown,” here unspools an anti-myth of Old Saint Nick as rampaging home wrecker and enslaver of elves. What with his weed habit and ingrained misogyny, and the part where he fathered children with someone other than Mrs. Claus, he is decidedly not the jolly old soul of lore. So this play with music, though it opens with a charming pair of singing elves, is an ill-advised choice for Santa believers.

And in this too-earthbound production, Mr. Kotis’s clever, messy comedy is not as much fun as it might be for the rest of us. It often feels like it could use an enlivening dash of the magic stuff that the Ghost of Christmas Present sprinkles around. Not that he makes an appearance; this show has plenty of spirits as it is.
