“They’re 25- to 45-years-old, well traveled, affluent professionals, mainly, who like to have fun and burn the candle at both ends,” said Anthony Ingham, the global brand leader of W Hotels, which has 54 locations worldwide. The first three Wake Up Calls took place this fall in Hollywood, Barcelona, and Bali; W Dubai is slated to host the fourth next year.

Historically, W has courted musicians through its Living Room Live program, in which emerging artists perform in the lounge area of their local W, and W Sound Suites, recording studios that exist within select hotels. “When we started brainstorming what we could do next, it felt like a natural evolution to produce a music festival,” Mr. Ingham said.

One would think that a music festival held in a hotel, a place with walls and smoke detectors and guests who may not be partaking in late night dance parties, would be less raucous than the type that take place on open plots of land, in the middle of nowhere. One would be wrong, at least in the case of Wake Up Call Barcelona, which took place the third weekend in September and courted 4,300 attendees, thanks to headlining artists like Martin Solveig and Robin Schulz.
