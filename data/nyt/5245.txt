Until recent weeks, Skyline Tower, a 67-story condominium under construction in the Court Square area of Long Island City, Queens, hadn’t drawn much interest from buyers. But its developers weren’t too concerned since the building is only about seven stories high right now.

But after Amazon announced last month that it would establish a HQ2 in Long Island City and would be renting space in the former Citicorp building right across from Skyline, the phones started to ring.

There was one lone inquiry before the announcement, according to the brokerage firm Modern Spaces, which is handling sales of the building’s 802 units. Now there are nearly 700 ready buyers. This is despite the fact that a teaser website went up just days ago; construction of a sales office only got underway last month; sales won’t begun until March; and the building isn’t expected to top out until the end of 2019.

Although Amazon plans to build a sprawling campus along the East River, the company has already leased one million square feet in the Citicorp building, officially named One Court Square. Amazon has said it would begin moving workers in next year.
