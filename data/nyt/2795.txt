Catch “Roma,” which our critics are calling one of this year’s best movies, and watch the queens return to strut their stuff in “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars.”

What’s Streaming

ROMA (2018) on Netflix. Alfonso Cuarón’s autobiographical film, which made this year’s list of best movies by the chief film critics of The New York Times (and topped Manohla Dargis’s list), starts streaming on Netflix in the midst of its theater run. Set in the 1970s and shot entirely in black and white, the film takes place in the Mexico City neighborhood for which it is named, where it follows Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a maid who works for, and lives with, a middle-class family. Its members, including four children and a dog, completely rely on Cleo, making her the centerpiece and stronghold of their ever-evolving world. The film, which isn’t propelled by a single story, moves forward with the characters and their changing lives. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott praised Cuarón for his use of “both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life.”

CHILLING ADVENTURES OF SABRINA: A MIDWINTER’S TALE on Netflix. This holiday special, which follows Season 1 of the “Sabrina” reboot, sprinkles witchcraft and chilly effects into a season usually devoted to cheer. This coven might not celebrate Christmas, but it’s the winter solstice, and the Church of Night still has some celebrating to do. The witches are singing pagan carols around the fire and, in true holiday spirit, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) conducts a séance and opens her home to real spirits.
