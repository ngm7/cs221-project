MAKING MAGIC at the New-York Historical Society (through Dec. 30 and on Jan. 1, 2-4 p.m.). Attend school during winter vacation? If that institution happened to be Hogwarts, many children would be eager to enroll. And that’s exactly the kind of curriculum they can expect at the society, which is celebrating its exhibition “Harry Potter: A History of Magic” with wizarding workshops at its DiMenna Children’s History Museum. Although the activities don’t include admission to the show, they do present opportunities to make wands, brew potions, unravel ciphers (hidden codes) and make badges representing the Hogwarts houses. The museum will rotate the crafts throughout the recess, so it encourages repeat visits.

‘THE MENDELSSOHN ELECTRIC’ at the Park Avenue Armory (Dec. 28-29, 2 and 5:30 p.m.). This isn’t the Mendelssohn music you’re familiar with, and not just because it’s electric. Commissioned by the armory and created by Trusty Sidekick Theater Company, this interactive production for audiences 10 and older illuminates the life of Fanny Mendelssohn (1805-47), a gifted composer and performer who largely labored in the shadow of her more famous younger brother, Felix. The show gives Fanny the spotlight while also exploring her relationship with Felix and with Wilhelm Hensel, the painter she eventually married. Featuring an original score that draws on 1980s musical influences, “The Mendelssohn Electric” reimagines all three as teenage pop strivers in 19th-century Berlin, where Felix becomes — here, literally — a rock star. Part of “The Electric Doyenne” trilogy, which Drew Petersen conceived as a tribute to women in music history, the production also includes two of Fanny Mendelssohn’s real compositions: an excerpt from her own wedding march and her “Easter” Sonata, once attributed to Felix but now acknowledged as hers alone.
