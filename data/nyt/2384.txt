After a certain age, Christmas can arrive with a little darkness. I’m used to it by now, the way the ghosts of Christmas Past sneak up on me, but it’s still hard. I miss my parents. I lament broken friendships. I worry about getting older, about the fate of the earth, about the presidency of this terrible man.

So there I was, one morning last week, sitting by the fire in my house in Maine as the tears rolled down. Then my 13-year-old Labrador, Ranger, came over and put his gray muzzle on my lap. His tail thumped upon the floor. Hey you, the dog seemed to say. Remember the good things. Like this?

When I focus on the good things, I think, above all, of being around a table with my family.

I could tell you about our Christmas Eve dinner tradition, which (since we live in Maine) is a platter of steamed lobsters, placed atop a bed of fresh green boughs clipped from the tree. I know it’s way too Martha Stewart, but we do it anyway, not least because my sister came up with this idea 20 years ago and it stuck.

That would be the sister with whom I had a falling out some years back. For a long time we didn’t speak. Now — gently, shyly, carefully — we have found our way back into each other’s lives again. Merry Christmas, sister mine. I love you.
