Re “Launched in 1977, Probe Enters Interstellar Space” (news article, Dec. 11):

The news that Voyager 2 has joined its twin Voyager 1 in interstellar space is a landmark moment in human history. The poet Robert Browning once wrote: “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, Or what’s a heaven for ?”

Through Voyager 2, which has taken humankind on a vicarious journey past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and now beyond the heliosphere, our collective grasp includes the heavens themselves.
