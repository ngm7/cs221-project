Yes, you often have to peer around a column to glimpse the art that’s up for sale at Phillips, given the poor sight lines in the auction house salesroom at 450 Park Avenue.

But that’s about to change. Phillips and Macklowe Properties are announcing that next fall, the auction house will move its New York headquarters practically next door — into 432 Park Avenue, the gridded luxury building by Rafael Viñoly Architects, one of the tallest residential towers in the Western Hemisphere.

“We’re looking at increasing our capabilities to present state-of-the-art exhibition space for auctions,” said Edward Dolman, who became Phillips’s chief executive four years ago. “It’s a serious upgrade.”

At the new address — for which an architect has yet to be selected — Phillips will have 55,000 square feet of space, including the so-called Park Avenue Cube, a white-glass modernist structure on the northwest corner of 56th Street and Park Avenue. The auction house will also occupy a double-height, column-free underground concourse of more than 30,000 square feet with direct access from Park Avenue, and executive office space with an entrance on East 57th Street.
