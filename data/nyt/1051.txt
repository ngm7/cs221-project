The acting chairman of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, Ann Marie Buerkle, wants to keep you safe this holiday season. Handsome Ron would like the same.

Handsome Ron is one of the many characters that Joseph Galbo, the commission’s social media specialist, developed to put a fresh spin on tried and true safety tips. Via the agency’s Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts, Mr. Galbo takes the C.P.S.C.’s standard safety messages and, as he thinks of it, puts them “in a fun wrapper.”

To create that fun wrapper, he pairs whimsical graphics featuring recurring characters, like Handsome Ron, a sun hat-sporting robin inspired by Ron Swanson from the television show “Parks and Recreation,” or Forcefield Baby, one of Mr. Galbo’s early creations, with text-based safety messages about topics ranging from Halloween costume dangers to not walking while texting.

“We have a challenge at the C.P.S.C. to get what we consider extremely important information to the consumer. There’s just so much noise out there, and so one of the avenues that we’ve chosen is,” Ms. Buerkle said with a laugh, “I’ll call it nontraditional.”
