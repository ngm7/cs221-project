A few years ago my brother, who knew I moderated reader comments for The New York Times, asked me about a specific commenter whose posts he found interesting: Richard Luettgen.

I was surprised. Mr. Luettgen commented for years on our articles and ultimately had nearly 30,000 of his posts published. Our community moderators and most active commenters long knew him for his prolific, articulate and often provocative writing, usually about politics .

But I hadnâ€™t realized how far his reputation stretched. Even my brother in Arlington, Va., had seen his comments.

Recently, I noticed Mr. Luettgen, who had worked as a management consultant, had not been posting comments and wondered why. Some readers did, too. On Wednesday we got a sad answer, when on a Bret Stephens column about Elizabeth Warren, a reader posted what amounted to the comment version of an obituary for Mr. Luettgen, who died on Dec. 1 at age 63.
