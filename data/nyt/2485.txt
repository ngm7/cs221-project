The bill would also streamline the cumbersome claims-reporting process established in the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act; it would eliminate the current process of mandatory mediation and the “cooling off period,” where complainants have to wait a certain amount of time before submitting an official complaint, lawmakers and aides confirmed. The new standards would also protect interns, congressional fellows and employees in district offices.

Congress’s secretive Office of Compliance, which since 2008 has paid $199,000 through a controlled fund to settle four sexual harassment claims, would continue to exist, but it would be required to establish an electronic system for accepting, tracking and reporting filed claims.

“I just don’t think you should leave the mess for the next group to clean up. I think it is on us,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, referring to the next Congress. “It really is an antiquated system,” she added. “It feels like a process that was better designed to protect politicians rather than victims.”

Final written language for the legislation has yet to be released, but lawmakers said they expected a vote in both chambers before the end of next week.

The House, under a separate resolution that will be brought to a vote in that chamber, would also provide legal advisers to assist in filing claims, aides said. But Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, told reporters that compromise was necessary and that this first step should not be left for the next Congress to handle.
