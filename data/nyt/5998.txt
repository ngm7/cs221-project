To the Editor:

For years, federal employees have suffered the indignity and financial harm of having to work without pay or being furloughed without pay as a result of Republican-engineered shutdowns of the federal government. Once again, they are suffering, this time being held hostage to President Trump’s insistence that Congress (and, ultimately, American taxpayers) fund the building of a medieval wall at our southern border, one that he had repeatedly promised would be paid for by Mexico and one that major opinion polls show a clear majority of Americans oppose.

Now, to add insult to injury, the president has ordered a pay freeze for federal workers, a fair percentage of whom are not receiving any pay at all because of his partial shutdown of the government. And so the president — a multibillionaire who continues to make ungodly sums of money in part by shamelessly exploiting his office for private gain (in clear violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution) and who, along with his family, continues to benefit from one of the biggest tax giveaways to the rich in American history — is denying modest raises to the ordinary working men and women who keep our Republic functioning.

Mr. Trump’s order is not only unfair; it’s obscene.

To the Editor:

It ’s not about the wall. The $5 billion that President Trump is asking for is 1/880th of the estimated $4.4 trillion federal budget for 2019 . It’s about the president.

It’s about telling lies nearly every day.

It’s about saying Democrats want open borders for drugs and criminals and rapists to enter the United States.
