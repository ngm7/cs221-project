[motor running] [groans] Oh. [cow cries] Something ain’t quite right with the baby, is there? [cow groans] [cow moans] Oh … [vehicle drives off] [vehicle approaches] [cow moos] [cows moo from shed] 60 pounds? 80. 80? God, some of the ones that seem so tiny are huge. Um-hmm. He looks like a 70, 60 … [cow groans softly] No dying on us. Oh, you’re one of those wobbly ones, ain’t you? Come on. All right, well … see you in an hour or two. [children shouting and playing] [rooster crowing] Oh, I almost got you in the face. [dog barks] Ready, Rosie? [child screams] O.K. Whoa! [laughter] That was a good jump! Carrie, Ken — Ken get on here. Ken, Trudy. Whee! They used, like, when Grandpa Foss was a baby, that’s the only thing that they had. Well, the back things are, like, really — I know … — You could snap it. We’ll have to fix this. Oh, all we got to do is put a board on. Yeah, well, I don’t want you guys getting stabbed by these nails back here. Where’s my bike? You want to go put a board on it right now? I have no idea if we even have a big enough board to put on that. [cow groans] Hey, there, [inaudible]. Ah! There you go. Come on. You got to work with me here. [sniffles] How’s that? There we go. Look at that. All by yourself. Oh! Easy now. Bring that leg back up. Bring it back up. I’ll fall down! Stand up! [cow bellows] [cow groans] [cow grunts] Well we’re just going to give him just a little bit, O.K.? We’ll give him just a little bit. What do you think? Should we name him? Um, Frodo? Frodo? [laughs] She’ll be Frodo. Well, I guess that’s as good name as any. Turn that heater on for you. [heater starts] There we go. There we go. O.K., buddy. Come here. Frodo, you got it. O.K., are you ready? Other way, bud. Other way. Oh, there. Yup, yup. There you go. See how he’s trying? He’s trying. His little tongue’s a-licking. Aah! Frodo, that’s just gross! [inaudible] at me. Look at him. He’s nursing. Good job, buddy. Good job. O.K., Mom, I’ll stop now? O.K., go ahead and pull. His tongue … Because he kind of stopped. You got to listen. Because sometimes they’ll take a breath and they’ll suck the milk down in their lungs at the same time. So you’ve got to — yeah, sometimes you’ve got to pull that out. … little nose a little twitch. Twitch, twitch, twitch … Oh, look it. He says, ”Hi, that’s such good stuff. I can’t even pull my tongue back in my mouth. [laughs softly] [motor running] [cow moos softly] [metal gate slams] Mom, Mom! Don’t let her out! She wants to lay down. Do you want her to lay down? What do you think? I don’t know. I’ve — first time I ever pulled a calf. Dad’s never left me alone. Well, she wants to lay down. Well, then let her lay down. Just let her go. Let her go. Are the knees trying to get out? There a little bit. [cow moos in distance] [cow groans loudly] Come on, push, baby. There you go. Push … push. [cow grunts] Oh! [cow groans loudly] There you go. Push. Blech. It doesn’t want to come out. No. It does not want to come out. Where’s your nose at, above. Right there. He’s not sideways, is he? The shoulder is, I think. I wouldn’t piddle around too long. I’m trying not to. Push — pull down on the baby. When you pull, pull down. It’s not like I’ve pulled a calf a 110 times, either. But you’ve pulled from a goat. [cow groans] You’re doing good, mama. There we go. Let her get dilated … [cow groans] [grunts] You just be careful. If she starts going down, you get out of the way. [grunts] Push, baby. Push. [cow moos] [cow cries repeatedly] [metal clangs] [thundering hooves] Hey! Hey! Hey! Woo! Woo! [cattle bellow]
