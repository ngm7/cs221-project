Justin Peck, the New York City Ballet's resident choreographer, created a series of dance films for the year's best actors. The scenarios put everyday characters in familiar situations: packed into a subway car, stuck in a doctor's office, caught in a downpour. But once they start moving, the actors turn our common experiences into welcome moments of enchantment.
