In many ways, Braxton Moral seems a lot like other teenagers. Most days, he goes to sleep around 11 p.m. and wakes up around 7 or 8 a.m. He likes to play video games, particularly World of Warcraft. He hangs out with his friends and goes to the movies.

But the similarities between Braxton and most other teenagers end there.

In May, Braxton is set to graduate from high school in Ulysses, Kan., and, just days later, from Harvard University. He hopes the bachelor’s degree he earns will pave the way for admission to Harvard Law School in the fall and ultimately a career in national politics, and maybe one day, the presidency.

“I’ve been going to Harvard now half as long as I’ve been going to regular school, so it’s really become a part of my life,” Braxton, 16, said on Saturday. “To see the conclusion and the results and the rewards of that, it’s a really an exciting prospect for me.”

From the time he was in middle school, Braxton has been studying at Harvard’s extension school, mostly taking classes online. His concentration was in government, with a minor in English.
