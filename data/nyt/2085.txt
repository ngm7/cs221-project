The clue “Japanese import,” in the Wednesday, Dec. 5 crossword puzzle by Alan Arbesfeld, stumped more solvers than any other entry in the puzzles from last week. That’s understandable, considering that the United States imports many things from Japan.

ISUZU, the Japanese automaker, was the answer. The company began exporting cars to the United States under its own name in 1981, although the name has not been top of mind for solvers, most likely because ISUZU has not sold passenger vehicles in the U.S. since the 1990s.

There are multiple reasons the business dried up in this country, but one sign of impending failure was the runaway success of the “Joe ISUZU” advertising campaign, without increased car sales. Joe ISUZU, the snarky, lying salesman played by the actor David Leisure, delighted consumers, but the campaign was a victim of its own success and did not increase sales in a significant way.
