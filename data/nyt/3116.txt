They opened with a revelatory account of Poulenc’s Clarinet Sonata, from 1962. It’s easy to be charmed by this piece, which begins with impishly jazzy spurts and hints of sardonic Parisian salon music. But these musicians emphasized sudden shifts and tart harmonies. You would almost have though Mr. Frost was improvising the clarinet part from the impetuous freshness of his playing. The pensive, wistful slow movement, as played here, seemed newly profound. And the madcap final movement, taken at a breathless tempo, had a touch of manic danger.

Bartok’s Romanian Folk Dances have been arranged many times for diverse instruments. The version by Jonas Dominique, played to the hilt here, refashions four of the dances into a shameless, brilliant showpiece. Mr. Frost and Mr. Mawe prepared the elaborate, rippling arrangements of some short Brahms works: three Hungarian Dances and three songs. The final dance allowed Mr. Frost to display his penchant for raspy, wheezing tone when the music turned frenetic.

And talk about earthy tone: For an encore, the two played a mercurial improvisation that led into a spirited klezmer dance written by Mr. Frost’s brother Goran, full of rapid-fire passagework, effortlessly dispatched by Mr. Frost, who all but danced as he played.
