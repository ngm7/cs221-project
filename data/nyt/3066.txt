William J. Conklin, a versatile architect who in the 1960s helped design the model community of Reston, Va., and oversaw the restoration of the Greek Revival temple that since 1848 has served as Brooklynâ€™s seat of government, died on Nov. 22 in Mitchellville, Md. He was 95.

His death was confirmed by his nephew David Conklin Denney.

Mr. Conklin was also a principal designer of the United States Navy Memorial, which was dedicated on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington in 1987.

He also worked with a design team, headed by the distinguished architect Wallace K. Harrison, that proposed the creation of a residential community, coupled with retail and office space, on landfill off Lower Manhattan. The concept was revised by Alex Cooper and Stanton Eckstut and led to Battery Park City on the Hudson River.
