The TV portion of the Golden Globes is equally stupid and special, sometimes nominating people who are very famous but not necessarily doing anything wonderful, and other times giving small or out-there shows a moment in the spotlight, something the Emmys can’t or won’t do as often.

As with all grab bags, the unpredictability is part of the game — which makes the good parts more fun to treasure and the lousy parts easier to dismiss. Here are some of the big hits and misses from this year’s nominations.

Drama surprises and snubs

“Bodyguard” is definitely the surprise nominee here, up against the big guns of “The Americans,” the star wattage of “Homecoming” and the universal acclaim of “Killing Eve” and “Pose.” Left out is last year’s winner, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which had a less-good second season but still plenty of buzz. “This Is Us” was also nominated the past two years but not this year. I didn’t expect “The Good Fight” to notch a nomination, so I don’t know if it’s a snub per se, but “The Good Fight” is an excellent drama that almost no one watches.
