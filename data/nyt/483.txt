At 34, Alexander Wang has had his fill of labels. “People like to say, ‘Oh, you’re a downtown brand,’” Mr. Wang said the other day, adding: “Yes, we’re geographically located downtown. But what does that actually mean? Why does geography have to define who you are?”

Mr. Wang does in fact spend much of his time with friends in the uptown precincts of Lexington Avenue, within sprinting distance of Barneys New York. He routinely scours the store’s corridors for a next generation of ladies who lunch, a cohort inclined to mix status-laden Chanel tweeds with darker, more subversive matter.

Mr. Wang set out, partly at least, to cater to that crowd, his C ollection 2 an improbable meld of commerce, convention and kink. Staged on Saturday evening in the subterranean depths of a tower in Brooklyn — the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank — the show was a waggish attempt to speak to a client who exists, for now, chiefly in his febrile mind.
