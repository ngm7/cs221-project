Re “Trump Blames Democrats for Deaths of Migrant Children in U.S. Custody” (news article, Dec. 30):

I’m not sure how many times these last couple of years that I’ve read stories with headlines that begin “Trump Blames ...” Just fill in the blanks. At first it was always “Hillary” no matter what the circumstance. Now, young children die while in custody of the United States under President Trump’s new border policies. Hey, it’s the Democrats’ fault.

Mr. Trump, having claimed to be “proud” to shut down the government for border security, now blames the Democrats, who he says are for “open borders.” Not true, but hey.

I thought that we were supposed to be tired of all the winning, but what we are tired of is all the whining. Man up, Mr. President. The buck stops with you.

There is no more surefire way to alienate American mothers who vote than to politicize the death of children. Congratulations, President Trump, and keep up the good work.
