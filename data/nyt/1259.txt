The word peregrinate has appeared in 39 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 9 in the movie review “In His Last Years, Oscar Wilde Is Far From ‘The Happy Prince’” by Jeannette Catsoulis:

A mopey yet gorgeous-looking wallow in the final years of the literary giant Oscar Wilde, “The Happy Prince” staggers around Europe with one eye on the grave and the other on the kinds of sorry mischief an unrepentant hedonist like Wilde could get up to.

Happiness, however, proves elusive. Opening in 1897 as Wilde is sprung from a British prison after serving two years for gross indecency, the movie watches him wander, exiled and frequently penniless, through Dieppe and Naples before expiring in Paris of meningitis three years later. Brief flashbacks to the humiliations of his trial and the balm of opening-night adulation — represented by a sea of ecstatically applauding Victorian toffs — interrupt his peregrinations and underline the tragedy of his fall.
