To the Editor:

Re “In Wisconsin, a Power Play for the Road” (front page, Dec. 6):

What do these things all have in common?

1. Republicans in Wisconsin have been trying to change state laws to strip power from a newly elected Democratic governor.

2. Republican senators refused to schedule a hearing and a vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice, to the Supreme Court.

3. Republican legislators have touted imaginary voter fraud and passed laws to suppress Democratic votes in a number of states.

4. Republicans appear to have brought about actual election fraud in North Carolina.

The pattern is clear: Republicans are willing to actively subvert democracy to maintain power.
