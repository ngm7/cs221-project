La’Roi Glover was director of player programs for the St. Louis Rams when the team drafted Aaron Donald, a defensive tackle out of Pittsburgh, in the first round of the 2014 draft. As a former interior lineman, Glover took great interest in the rookie. And Donald, it turned out, took great interest in his craft.

“I’d usually get to the office around 5, 6 in the morning. I’d get there, and Aaron Donald would be there by himself, watching tape,” said Glover, now an assistant defensive line coach for the Jets. “He wouldn’t say two words. He’d get to the building early and go to work. And lift everything in the weight room. On the practice field, he took it very, very seriously. You can see why he’s having the success he’s having today.”

Man, the success he’s having today. The Rams are 12-3, and Donald has made himself a candidate for the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award. With 19.5 sacks, atop the rankings, he has already set a league record for true defensive tackles and, with a game left, has an outside chance of reaching the single-season mark for all players (22.5), set by Giants defensive end Michael Strahan in 2001. Donald is also attempting to become the first interior lineman to lead the N.F.L. in sacks since Glover did it in 2000, when he racked up 17 for the New Orleans Saints.

Donald is a singular talent. As Denver Broncos guard Connor McGovern told Sports Illustrated’s Robert Klemko, “He can scratch his knees standing up, but he still has that natural pad level where he can lift you up and forklift you.”
