A deadly tsunami struck Indonesia on Saturday, killing at least 373 people and injuring more than 1,459 others.

Rescuers were searching for survivors in Indonesiaâ€™s Sunda Strait. It has been a devastating year for the country, which has seen a strong earthquake and tsunami, an airline crash and fires that together have killed more than 4,500 people, the most in more than a decade.

Nonprofit organizations and charities have mobilized to bring relief to those people affected by the tsunami. If you want to help, here are some pointers and a list of some of those organizations.
