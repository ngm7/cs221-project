Deval Patrick, the former two-term Democratic governor of Massachusetts, said Thursday morning that he would not be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, blaming the “cruelty of our elections process” and how it could affect his loved ones.

A statement by Mr. Patrick, posted to his Facebook page at 7 a.m., confirmed reports from associates earlier this week that he had decided against mounting a presidential campaign after discussing it for months with advisers and his wife, Diane Patrick, and other family members, while traveling around the country to support Democratic candidates in the midterm elections.

“I’ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact. But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask,” Mr. Patrick said in the statement. He did not specify who he was referring to.
