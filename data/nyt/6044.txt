In August 2017, I went to Houston Methodist Hospital to report on the health impacts of Hurricane Harvey: a tiny cut that marinated in floodwaters and became a raging infection; a displaced chemotherapy outpatient whom staff members scoured the city to locate and bring in for care. Some workers had lost their own homes, and the chief of the heart failure and transplant division, who is under 5 feet tall, walked through floodwaters up to her chin to get to work. (Billions of dollars of fortifications had protected Methodist and other Texas Medical Center hospitals from flooding, but they became islands for a time.) Hospital executives, among the most empathetic I’ve ever met, camped in their offices and distributed hugs, encouragement and bonuses. The crisis extended as the storm moved east, disabling other hospitals, and ambulance crews transferred their patients to Houston.

An email about a patient from a different hospital shifted my focus, because her story offered a window into many of the most critical aspects of the region’s hurricane response. Our projects can take us in unexpected directions, and we often do not know what the result, or the impact, of an investigation will be when we begin.

Cassandra Dills-Dailey, known as Casey, had undergone surgery to remove a benign adrenal tumor at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. A doctor newly graduated from medical school discharged her before the storm hit, sending her home without a critical steroid medication.
