Scholarly consensus now holds that Bach composed some of the “Brandenburg” Concertos during his Köthen tenure and others in his final years at Weimar. But although his aristocratic employers, had they known about it, might have disapproved of his formally dedicating any of “their” music to someone else, it hardly seems likely that in 1721 Bach could have drawn upon an untapped hoard of concertos.

So by all indications, the “Brandenburgs” would have been included in the weekly programs of the Köthen palace concerts, and these pieces do indeed line up well with Leopold’s documented interests. Remarkably, the prince’s investiture festivities, in 1716, had included not only a superabundance of concert offerings, but also a scholarly oration exploring how musical order and societal order are analogous.

As it happens, each of the six “Brandenburgs” delves into issues of hierarchy and order. The Sixth is musically and socially the most unconventional of the set. Two violas, with cello, are pitted against two viols, with violone.

At the time, violas were customarily low-rent, undemanding orchestral instruments, while viols were high-end, virtuoso solo instruments. Bach reversed these roles, such that the violas perform virtuosic solo lines while the viols amble along in repeated eighth notes. Pursuing these two radical instrumental treatments within the same work was unprecedented (and wouldn’t be imitated).
