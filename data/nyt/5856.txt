FRIDAY PUZZLE — I predict this puzzle by David Steinberg will be a divisive one for solvers. On the plus side, there are some very crunchy, challenging general-knowledge entries, with tough cluing that might not be in many wheelhouses. On the minus side, there are some very crunchy, challenging general-knowledge entries, with tough cluing that might not be in many wheelhouses.

Let me roll that back for a moment. What I’m saying is that Mr. Steinberg’s puzzle has a lot of stuff in it that you either know or you don’t, and I’m not entirely sure that the crossings will be of much help here. Take 17A, for example. You might or might not know the “1997 Notorious B.I.G. hit,” GOING BACK TO CALI, but if you are trying to get it through the crossings, you had better know what ELOCUTE and FECUND mean, or that a PICA is 12 points, typographically speaking, or what a CELESTA is. And heaven help you if you don’t know that the Lego company is run by the DANES.

And I, personally, missed out on reading “Gil Blas,” so the bottom stack was tough for me, but at least the crossings were a bit easier, so I was able to discover its author, ALAIN-RENÉ LESAGE.

On a separate note, please help me welcome Caitlin Lovinger back tomorrow to the weekend Wordplay columns.
