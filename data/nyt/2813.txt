Becca writes: My family celebrates Christmas in the tradition of a different country every year. This year is Norway, and my mom wants to serve salmon. I think we should serve reindeer stew instead because it tastes better than salmon, it’s traditional and it’s funnier. I’ve agreed to make it, and I’ve already ordered reindeer meat as well as fake reindeer horns as a garnish.

Perhaps you have indeed eaten reindeer stew for laughs in Norway, but the most common Christmas dinner in that country is pork or lamb ribs. But even if my research matched yours, it’s still your mom’s Jul. With her permission, you can add a side of Rudolph stew to the board (minus the morbid accompaniments, please). But if she says no, thus should end your reindeer games. Be happy and merry, and be sure you leave some risengrynsgrøt out for the barn gnome. You don’t want to cross that guy.
