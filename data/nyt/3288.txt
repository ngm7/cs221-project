SPRINGSTEEN ON BROADWAY on Netflix. If you are torn over missing Bruce Springsteen’s extremely popular solo stage show, this Netflix film may ease the pain. It captures the Boss like we have rarely seen him before: He doesn’t belt out his most famous hits for thousands, but tones down lesser-known songs and delivers them with a seriousness that is lightened by his self-deprecating humor. (“I’m Mr. Born to Run,” he jokes. “I currently live 10 minutes from my hometown.”) Half of the performance is monologue, largely based on his 2016 memoir. And while there is nothing quite like sitting a few feet away from Springsteen himself, the movie has its treasures, too. “It’s a master class in pacing, dynamics, modulation of volume and tone,” Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times. “The film brings you right up onstage with Springsteen, giving you a more intimate view of his technique — understated, seemingly casual but absolutely controlled — than you could get in the theater.”



ICHI THE KILLER (2003) on Amazon, Google Play, Shudder, Vudu and YouTube. Adapted from the manga series by Hideo Yamamoto, this savage Japanese horror flick by Takashi Miike follows a yakuza masochist (Tadanobu Asano) who sets out to find the sadistic killer (Nao Omori) who murdered his boss.
