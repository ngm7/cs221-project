Rarely might one expect much drama at the annual gathering of the Group of 20 leaders, except perhaps during a major global crisis, such as the financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009. Still these are important meetings at which American leadership normally yields significant outcomes that benefit the country’s economy and national security.

However, with Donald Trump as president, one can be forgiven for worrying what chaos may ensue at yet another multilateral forum. I have learned to brace myself for blows to our national standing every time Mr. Trump travels abroad — the mental equivalent of a pre-emptive defensive crouch.

Last week’s meeting in Buenos Aires was no different. In fact, it appeared to be an even more inauspicious moment than usual for a high-stakes foreign trip. Ukraine and Russia remain on hair-trigger war footing, while President Trump resorted inexplicably to his classic “both sides-ism” rather than clearly condemning Russian aggression.

Having whitewashed the Saudi crown prince’s apparent direct involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump abandoned all pretense of principled leadership by pledging to pursue business as usual with the Saudis. Then, just as the president was about to be wheels-up, the guilty plea by his former lawyer Michael Cohen revealed that Mr. Trump was more enmeshed in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the 2016 presidential campaign than he had previously acknowledged.
