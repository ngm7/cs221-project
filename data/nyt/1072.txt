Anish Kapoor, a London-based artist known for ambitious public works, said on Thursday that National Rifle Association had agreed to erase an image of his Chicago sculpture known as the Bean from one of its videos, settling his lawsuit against the group.

“We are pleased to declare victory over the N.R.A.,” Mr. Kapoor said in a statement.

His 110-ton stainless steel sculpture in Chicago’s Millennium Park, titled “Cloud Gate” but more popularly known by its shape, was completed in 2006 and has become a popular tourist attraction, especially because of how it reflects the city’s skyline.

The N.R.A. used a shot of the work in a video last year called “The Violence of Lies.” In it, a spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, delivers a straight-to-camera message excoriating liberals for “using their media to assassinate real news” and teaching children that President Trump “is another Hitler,” among other statements.
