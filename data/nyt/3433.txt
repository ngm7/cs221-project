You may think the Trump administration’s appetite for trade wars couldn’t get much bigger. You’d be wrong. Last week, the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, blocked the nomination of new judges to the World Trade Organization’s appellate body, a move that could make it impossible for the United States to enforce whatever wins it scores against China.

Mr. Lighthizer, who is America’s main negotiator in its current round of trade talks with China, is a longtime lawyer for the steel industry, which for years has complained that the W.T.O. makes it too difficult for the United States to impose trade remedies for unfair practices. The seven-member appellate body hears appeals in disputes between W.T.O. members. But rather than fix the problems, Mr. Lighthizer appears to prefer blowing up the entire system.

At a meeting of the W.T.O.’s General Council in mid-December, the European Union and 11 nations, including China, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, proposed changes to the body’s dispute settlement system in response to American complaints. They hoped the amendments would convince the United States to allow vacancies on the appellate panel to be filled.

Instead, the United States rejected all the changes while refusing to put forward proposals of its own, and i t has blocked the reappointments of appellate judges. The W.T.O. has histori cally operated through consensus, with any single country able to veto proposed changes. So the court is down to its bare minimum of three out of seven members to form a quorum. When two of those members’ terms expire next year, the court will no longer be able to rule on any appeal.
