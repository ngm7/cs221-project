The instructions suggested: “Do not place traps where birds and nontarget animals may come into contact.” This covered, presumably, kittens and toddlers. And they concluded with a refreshing frankness: “Consider other traps for a more humane option.”

But was there any humane way to get rid of pests? These two mice, their only crime was to be mice.

Rather than sitting around moping about their fate, I went to McGuckin Hardware to see what “a more humane option” might look like. I found the Traps/Bait aisle teeming with devices to murder or repel both mice and rats.

Here were the wooden snap traps of old, with their trip pedals and spring-loaded guillotines. A buck 99, and humane in their efficiency: the blow instantaneous, out of nowhere. Plus, the mice got to spend their last moments of mousehood with their nibblers full of cheese.

Poison was another old reliable — d-Con Pro bragged: “Guaranteed to kill.” But who knew how much they suffered first.

Some of the products here were intended not to kill, but to drive varmints crazy. An attic light bulb gave off “sonic waves”; these have the effect of “irritating rodents, causing them to leave the area.” An ultrasonic gadget showed a mouse hopping downstairs toward the nearest exit. Another device employed essential oils to “trigger escape/avoidance behavior.”
