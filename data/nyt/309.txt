Happy Holidays, runners! I’m sitting near my Christmas tree with my dog at my feet and a spreadsheet full of all the holiday gifts I have yet to buy. If you’re like me, you have a few runners on your list. I have recommendations.

An important note: I don’t accept samples, and no one paid for these placements. This list is based on things that I have used and loved, books I’ve read and conversations with folks in the running industry about what they predict will be the hot gifts this year.

Nathan QuickStart 4L Race Vest

This lightweight vest has enough water capacity to make sure you stay hydrated on long runs, but also extra space to stash other stuff like sports drinks, fuel and even a long sleeve shirt or a rain shell if you’re worried about changing weather. I switched to this vest over the summer; it’s far less bulky than my previous one. Just make sure that you (or your runner) don’t wear one to a race without checking to see if they’re allowed. Some race officials consider them backpacks, which are banned in a lot of events.
