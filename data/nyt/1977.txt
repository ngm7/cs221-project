The Upright Citizens Brigade comedy theater, facing significant financial challenges, announced that it was laying off staff members on Tuesday, including much of its sales and marketing teams.

The theater, which has four spaces, including the flagship that opened in Hell’s Kitchen last year, has struggled in its new location, in part because of increased competition and high rents.

“After much thought and careful consideration, we have decided to streamline our business entities, focusing our efforts on the cornerstone of our organization: our school programs and our theaters, while downsizing some of our digital and sales and marketing initiatives,” U.C.B. said in a statement. “This will enable us to grow our programs and theaters in a way that our community has come to expect from U.C.B. without having to compromise the very heart and soul of this organization. We strongly believe that redoubling our efforts and returning to our roots is not only the right thing to do for the organization but also for our current and future students, performers, and audience members.”

The theater did not say how many staff members were cut, but a majority were New York-based. Some employees found out early Tuesday about the layoffs, according to a now-deleted post on Twitter from one worker who lost his job. A spokeswoman for the theater said that classes and teachers would not be affected.
