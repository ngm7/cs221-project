COUNTERPART 9 p.m. on Starz. When this multidimensional thriller debuted about a year ago, the Times critic Mike Hale called it “the most entertaining new series of the winter.” J.K. Simmons stars as two versions of the same character. One is a low-level worker with the United Nations in Berlin. The other, living in a parallel dimension spun off from the real world 30 years earlier, is a coldblooded spy. The first season ended with the two versions of the characters each getting stuck in the other’s dimension. The second season, debuting Sunday night, picks up the story from there, allowing Simmons more time to delve into the nuances of this challenging double role. “I considered all kinds of subtle things in terms of appearance that ultimately seemed unnecessary,” the actor told The Times earlier this year. “Because the more interesting thing was how has a person really changed at his core in the second 30 years of his life due to his environment, his experiences.”
