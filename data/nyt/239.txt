SATURDAY PUZZLE — We’re officially in the homestretch of 2018. Ryan McCarty, who started this year as a newbie, has become a steady weekend constructor and developed a flair for building chewy grids around a combination of newfangled/classic and high/low references. I found myself significantly misdirected more than once today, which might have been just me, but Mr. McCarty’s counterintuitive cluing added a fun, intriguing little something to the challenge of a Saturday.

Structure buffs will notice that this grid is a little wider than it is tall, something that I usually gloss over as a solver unless the rest of the design strongly refers to the dimensions. If you have ever wondered about the ramifications of messing with these configurations, read the notes today for a constructor’s perspective, as well as mention of Mr. McCarty’s other talents (he’s a singer and composer).

Tricky Clues

’Tis the season to be surrounded on all sides by sniffles and sneezes, so I triumphantly entered “Sinus infection” for 36A, “Head shot,” almost at the very beginning of this grid. And it worked for a long time! Look at all the letters it has in common with BOTOX INJECTION: Look at them! I also had “Seneca” for HORACE and got stuck with a couple of answers that I was sure were right but just wouldn’t expand or contract to fit — “vision test” for INKBLOT TEST, “Billie” for HORNE — that further slowed me down.

20A: The capital U in this clue denotes a certain magazine that you may not even know about if you are living off the land, for example, or have found some other way to avoid grocery store lines. “Us” is a gossip rag, and CELEBs keep it afloat.
