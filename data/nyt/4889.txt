Mel Hutchins, the All-American center who helped elevate Brigham Young University to the top ranks of college basketball in 1951 and became an N.B.A. All-Star and a senior member of a remarkable sports family, died on Wednesday in Encinitas, Calif. He was 90.

His son, Matthew, who confirmed the death, said he had been treated for Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

At 6 feet 5 inches, Hutchins was hardly a big man, but he was an outstanding rebounder, both at Brigham Young and as a professional. He also gained acclaim for his defensive skills, and he had a nifty jump shot when that was first becoming an offensive weapon.

Hutchins joined with the six-foot forward Roland Minson in taking Brigham Young to the championship of the 1951 National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden, at a time when it rivaled the N.C.A.A. championship tournament in prestige. A few days later, the Cougars reached the second round of the West regionals in the N.C.A.A. tournament before they were eliminated.

The N.I.T. crown was the first national championship in any sport for Brigham Young, which is best known for its affiliation with the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
