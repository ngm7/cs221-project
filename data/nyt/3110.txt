CRYPTIC CROSSWORD — It’s an odd feeling to love something so much and to be only passingly good at it, but that’s my situation when it comes to cryptic crosswords. It’s also understandable that I am better at cryptic crosswords that are written by American constructors than the ones by British “setters,” because I am less likely to be familiar with elements of British pop culture.

That doesn’t stop me from trying, though, mainly because once I understood how to decipher the clues, I discovered how much fun they were. I still struggle over many of the clues, but that is part of the fun for me: the struggle where you can feel your brain holding back the needed information like a dam, then the satisfying burst as the information comes rushing forward so you can have your “Aha!” moment. I had a lot of those in Daniel Raymon’s terrific puzzle.

If you are just starting, the most basic rule to remember is that there are really only two parts to a cryptic clue: the definition of the answer and the wordplay. The definition will always be at either the beginning or the end of the clue, never in the middle. Then, all you need to do is figure out what the heck the constructor is talking about in the wordplay. And there are many ways for the constructor to obscure the answer, but fortunately, there are online resources where you can learn all about them. I’ve listed a few below.

It was very exciting to get one right off the bat at 1A: “Playwright mom was introduced to (5),” calling for a five-letter word. I guessed correctly that the clue meant that we should connect the word MA to a word for “introduced,” and the answer turned out to be MAMET, for the playwright David MAMET. MA + MET = MAMET.
