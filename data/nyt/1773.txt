BUENOS AIRES — When Zaira Mauas, a lifelong fan of the soccer club River Plate, stepped inside the Monumental stadium two weeks ago, she could barely contain her excitement.

“I was going crazy — I had a level of anxiety and nerves that is difficult to explain,” said Mauas, a 35-year-old travel agent who was among the tens of thousands of River fans who had been fortunate to obtain a ticket for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final against archrival Boca Juniors. “I was so happy and had an incredible amount of adrenaline.”

The day didn’t go as planned. Boca’s bus was attacked by River fans, its players were treated for injuries from broken glass and drifting pepper spray, and the game’s kickoff was delayed several times. Mauas wound up seeking medical assistance after sitting for hours in the sun waiting for the match to start. It never did.

After the game was postponed for a second time the next day, South American soccer authorities decided the long-anticipated final between these two Buenos Aires teams would not be played in Argentina at all. Instead, they announced that it would be moved to Spain.
