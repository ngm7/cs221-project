A high school football player in Indiana was charged with murder on Monday after the authorities said he fatally stabbed a 17-year-old classmate who was six months pregnant with their child.

The football player, Aaron Trejo, 16, told the authorities that he had gotten into a fight with the girl, Breana Rouhselang, a former cheerleader, because she had waited too long to tell him about the pregnancy and it was too late to get an abortion.

“I took action,” Mr. Trejo said, according to the police. “I took her life.”

Mr. Trejo, who was charged as an adult, also faces one count of feticide. He was being held without bail at the St. Joseph County Jail.

The case has gripped Mishawaka, Ind., a city of about 50,000, and Mishawaka High School, where both students were in their junior year and where students walked out on Monday morning for a moment of silence to honor Ms. Rouhselang. She had played softball and served as a manager for the football team before she went missing over the weekend.
