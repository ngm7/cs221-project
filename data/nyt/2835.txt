Kissing, as these photos show, doesn’t always require baring one’s soul. Interspersed between amorous moments are more dramatic and humorous demonstrations. Adults coax toddlers to imitate them, while giggling childhood friends peck one another’s cheeks. And it’s not unreasonable to ask whether it was a sense of devotion or a desire to perform for the camera that inspired a man to stretch his torso across the floor to reach his partner’s lips.

Since the majority of couples in the collection are anonymous, many of these images can also serve as ways for us to reflect on our own experiences of kissing. For some, a pair’s steamy embrace on a loveseat may bring back memories of the exhilarating nervousness that gives way to ecstasy. Others, meanwhile, might feel uncomfortable about how they may have once looked as ridiculous as the man in swim trunks thrusting out his tongue as he goes in for a French kiss.

“You start to put yourself in the photograph and wonder all these questions for which there’s no answers,” Ms. Levine said. “You’re supplying all the answers.”
