Yes, this is another one of those stories.

An N.F.L. team signs a quarterback who has never succeeded at the professional level. And fans everywhere look at each other and say, “But what about ...?”

This time, the team is the Redskins, and the quarterback is Josh Johnson. Washington is in need of a passer, having gone through Alex Smith and Colt McCoy, both lost with broken legs. That leaves the team with Mark Sanchez, still best remembered for fumbling the ball after colliding with the rear end of his teammate with the Jets in 2012. When signed earlier this year he had not thrown a pass since 2016.

Sanchez’s backup will now be Johnson, whose N.F.L. drought is even longer. A fifth-round draft pick out of San Diego in 2008, he last threw a pass in the league in 2011, for the Buccaneers, and since then has been bouncing around the benches and practice squads of several teams.

He even suited up for the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the now defunct United Football League and was briefly on the roster of the San Diego Fleet, part of the new Alliance of American Football set to begin in 2019.
