Kathie Lee Gifford, the co-anchor of the popular fourth hour of NBC’s “Today,” tearfully announced to viewers on Tuesday that she would be leaving the morning show in April.

“I’ve been in this business for 120 years and never worked with a more beautiful — a more beautiful — group of people who just give, give, give, give,” Ms. Gifford said as her co-host, Hoda Kotb, welled up next to her.

Ms. Gifford and Ms. Kotb, and their ever-present glasses of wine, have been a fixture of NBC’s morning lineup for the last decade.

Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, said that Ms. Gifford was staying on until April to mark her 11th anniversary of hosting the show with Ms. Kotb. He also said that the network would announce succession plans before Ms. Gifford’s departure and that they “will, of course, continue to include Hoda.”
