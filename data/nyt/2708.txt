CBS News reached a legal settlement with three women who accused the network of not doing enough to stop one of its anchors, Charlie Rose, from sexually harassing them.

The three women had worked for either Mr. Rose or CBS when he was a host of “CBS This Morning” and a correspondent for “60 Minutes.”

The network fired Mr. Rose last year after The Washington Post published the stories of several women who said that Mr. Rose had treated them inappropriately when they worked for him over the course of several decades. PBS, the longtime home of the “Charlie Rose” interview show, also cut ties with Mr. Rose.

Three recent employees — Katherine Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei — sued the network and Mr. Rose this year after another article in The Post indicated that the network had ignored complaints from CBS employees who worked with him.
