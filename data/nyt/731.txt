Brett Favre, the former N.F.L. quarterback, has developed a focus on veterans in his life after football: He spoke at the National Veterans Wheelchair Games this year, and he recently teamed up with a group that trains shelter dogs and places them with veterans struggling with post-combat stress and anxiety.

So when he received a request to make a video referring to patriots, servicemen and the U.S.S. Liberty, via a platform that allows fans to request personalized videos from celebrities, he believed he was honoring a veterans organization, he said.

In fact, the request was laced with obscure anti-Semitic messages and had ties to a hate group.

Mr. Favre was among several celebrities who were recently targeted on Cameo, a platform on which fans pay celebrities for personalized video messages, often for birthdays or other special occasions. Soulja Boy Tell ’Em, the rapper, and Andy Dick, the comedian, also recorded similar messages. All said they were tricked and did not know that the request was connected to extremism.

Cameo has condemned the requests as a “blatant misuse” of its platform and a “gross misrepresentation of the talent’s political beliefs.”
