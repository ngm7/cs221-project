CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (2009) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Netflix and Vudu. Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has been a longtime inventor, although not a very good one. Most of his inventions have failed, putting Flint at the epicenter of mockery. But with one of them, a machine that converts water into food (yes, that means juicy cheeseburgers falling from the sky), Flint finally has a chance to be a hero. When the machine malfunctions, however, his aptly named island home, Swallow Falls, and the rest of the world, are at risk of being buried beneath mounds of ice cream, spaghetti and pancakes.

THE LAND BEFORE TIME (1988) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, HBO and Vudu. Littlefoot, a baby longneck dinosaur (voiced by Gabriel Damon), seems to be the last of his kind when his mother (voiced by Helen Shaver) dies after being wounded by a Tyrannosaurus rex. Just before her death, she urges Littlefoot to venture to the Great Valley, where he can find others like him and eat lush, green leaves to his heart’s content. He joins a group of other young dinos, all from different species, to venture to this fabled land. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised the film and lauded the creatures as “cute,” saying, “It’s the only way to describe the enchanting behavior of these little beings, and in fact it hardly does them justice.”
