LONDON — For 44 minutes, Chelsea chased. Dutifully, doggedly, Maurizio Sarri’s players trailed after Manchester City, after the ball. They tracked runs. They shuttled from one side of the Stamford Bridge field to the other. They cleared crosses and intercepted passes, and they thumped the ball away, as far as it would go. Then they caught their breath, strained their sinews and got ready to do it all again.

The previous day, as he outlined the significance of this game, Pep Guardiola had made the slightest of slips of the tongue. “We play five hypothetical strong teams in the league, and Chelsea is the last one,” the Manchester City coach said.

What he meant, of course, was abundantly clear: Theoretically, there are five Premier League teams who would pretend to be Manchester City’s equal. But — written down, devoid of intonation and context — it took on another meaning: that those teams are rather stronger in theory than they are in practice.

That is, certainly, the way City had made it look thus far. It has already won, comfortably, at Arsenal and eased past Tottenham at the Spurs’ temporary home at Wembley. It took a point at Anfield, against Liverpool, and would have won had Riyad Mahrez converted a late penalty. Manchester United — the only one of its peers City has faced at home — was dispatched, easily, a few weeks ago.
