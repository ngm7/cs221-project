He recanted his abortion-rights politics and opinion of supply-side economics as ”voodoo” to be picked as Ronald Reagan’s running mate in 1980. Eight years later, he painted his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, as a mentally unstable, unpatriotic left-wing radical, an attack that culminated in the Willie Horton ad, an infamous spot even Mr. Trump’s dirty trickster Roger Stone called “racist.”

Even his famous 1988 convention speech pledge — “read my lips: no new taxes” — was designed to boost enthusiasm for his presidential candidacy among the party’s conservative wing.

But when Mr. Bush broke that promise two years later, conservatives never forgave him. The fallout contributed to his re-election loss in 1992. And now, more than a quarter century later, there’s little question that the forces that once pulled Mr. Bush to the right have won the battle for the Republican Party.

A number of political scientists have dug deep into years of roll call votes and concluded that Republicans are far more conservative than even a decade ago. Many moderate congressional Republicans, particularly those who opposed Mr. Trump, either lost their re-election bids or retired to avoid rough primary battles.

That’s a shift Mr. Bush felt personally. After his son Jeb Bush lost the Republican nomination in 2015, the former president did not attend the national party convention.

He told the author Mark K. Updegrove that he voted for Hillary Clinton.

“I don’t know much about him, but I know he’s a blowhard. And I’m not too excited about him being a leader,” Mr. Bush said of Mr. Trump in May 2016, according to Mr. Updegrove.

Mr. Trump will attend Mr. Bush’s funeral in Washington this week, but will not give a eulogy.

If Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 was when moderate Republicans lost their final battle, then the midterms may be remembered as their apocalyptic era, leaving them cowering in a bunker as once-loyal suburban voters cast ballots for Democrats.
