Re “Why Work Friendships Can Be So Awkward” (Business Day, Nov. 26):

Another dimension of problematic issues of work friendships is the systemic effect on co-workers.

When a professional colleague is known to be a personal friend of another colleague, this dual relationship affects everyone. People working with, or supervised by, someone who is known to be a friend of the chief executive may be reluctant to register concerns or complaints about that colleague for fear of having their concerns dismissed — or of being dismissed oneself.

This situation is made worse when someone is hired by an organization because he or she is a friend of someone in a position to hire, and the lack of requisite skills soon surfaces. The consequent effect on productivity, motivation and morale can permeate a work system.

When friendships in the workplace and their perceived privilege come to dominate the system, it quickly becomes apparent to all that it’s not what you do; it’s whom you know that matters.
