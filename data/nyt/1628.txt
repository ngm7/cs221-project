“I’m not like Normani. I can’t sing and dance at the same time, girl — I get tired.”

This was Cardi B, midway through her set at Madison Square Garden on Friday night, taking a quick water break and, as is her wont — her gift — advertising the fact that she was taking a quick water break so endearingly that you almost overlooked what was really happening.

This time last year, she had a couple of big singles, a famous boyfriend and a growing profile. Now she has one of the year’s most impressive albums, an unbroken string of smash hit guest appearances, a boyfriend-turned-husband who’s soon to be her ex, and a daughter.

And she was the headliner of this year’s installment of Z100’s Jingle Ball, part of a traveling set of end-of-year revues in support of, and sponsored by, iHeartRadio pop stations around the country.

By any metric, her ascent has been rapid. But there she was, the 12th performer of the night, one of the most successful of the group, and the only one who bore almost no traces of the old star-making machine.
