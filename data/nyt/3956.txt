When it comes to “tasty or temporary,” however, Mr. Zhao and I agreed that this ice cream gift basket from Jeni’s Ice Cream, shipped next-day and packed in dry ice, would make either of us happy this holiday. Odds are it’ll make anyone on your list happy, too. Sure, there are plenty of other gift baskets that don’t disappoint, but seriously: ice cream. It’s always a winner, even in winter.

Speaking of cold weather, Christine Cyr Clisset, senior editor at Wirecutter, dropped me a line to let me know they have new guides to the best pajamas for women and men, and even for children. Best of all, she said that the author of the guide went to great lengths to make sure she tested and found options in inclusive sizes.

As someone who doesn’t always have the luxury of grabbing something off the rack at most big box stores, I can appreciate that — and if it’s tough for you to find clothes that fit comfortably, you’ll find pajama options here. After all, your pajamas should be some of the most comfortable clothes you wear, right?

Oh, and check if those pajamas offer two-day shipping. It might not be too late to buy a special someone a matching pair.
