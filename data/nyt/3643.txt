Among Russia’s 2016 targets: African Americans

A deeper look at Russia’s extraordinary social media influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election revealed efforts to target African Americans and suppress Democratic voter turnout, according to two new reports commissioned by the Senate.

The reports also showed that Russia utilized every digital surface available, including Instagram where its efforts were as effective or more effective than activity on Facebook.

Why it matters: The sweeping reports add new color to the known outlines of Russia’s disinformation campaign, confirming earlier findings that it was designed to boost then-candidate Donald Trump and widen fissures in American society.
