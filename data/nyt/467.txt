If it’s been a while since you got in touch with your senses, the choreographer Moriah Evans can help: She likes to create experiences not only for her dancers, whose movement jerks and stutters as if an electrical current is passing through their spines, but also for her audiences.

“If a physical quest is visceral, it can be felt in others,” Ms. Evans said. “Kinesthetic empathy, these things we talk about in what it means to dance and to watch dance, are real. Observing is also contributing to the energy in the room.”

In “Configure,” at the Kitchen beginning on Wednesday, Ms. Evans — making a rare appearance as a dancer in her own work — and four others work hard to feel the deepest parts of their bodies, parts most of us are unaware of. Ms. Evans offered a hypothetical: “Does your uterus move your pelvis versus your pelvis moving your uterus?” Ms. Evans said. “Of course, you can’t do this. It’s speculative.”

But it is an example of the type of sensation Ms. Evans probes in “Configure,” in which performers quiver and vibrate, get lost in bouts of laughing and crying, and jump explosively as if on pogo sticks. Lizzie Feidelson, one of the dancers, said that while the movement is extreme, “it’s collectively experienced by us, and so that can feel really fun.”
