3) Find ways to increase the percentage of the population, especially among the elderly, who execute a living will or advance directive for health care. When there are no such documents and no guidance from family members, allow doctors to exercise common sense depending on circumstances instead of doing everything possible to prolong life no matter how futile or costly.

I am all in favor of universal health care. “Medicare for All” seems to be the rallying cry. I just want to point out one important thing — Medicare is not cheap. I’m 71 years old and have been on Medicare for several years. It is an excellent program. It has seen me and my husband through a couple of hospitalizations with little or no extra cost.

But we pay for Medicare, over $260 per month deducted from our Social Security checks plus insurance premiums for supplemental insurance and the prescription program, plus the doughnut hole for a while longer. I take a medication that is not on drug formularies because of cost and have to sweat whether I can get an exception every year.

If Medicare for All is just code for universal health care, great. If it is literally Medicare for All, be warned: It might be costly for lower-income people.

The principal problems with our health care system are fairly clear: high cost, uneven access across socioeconomic echelons, poor outcomes for poor people, and lack of portability of insurance from one job to the next and from one location to another.
