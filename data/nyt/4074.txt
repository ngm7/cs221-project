When “The Shining” debuted in theaters in 1980, critics sniffed with indifference.

There was muted praise for Jack Nicholson’s performance as a caretaker gone mad at a wintry resort, while Variety wrote that the director, Stanley Kubrick, destroyed “all that was so terrifying about Stephen King’s best-seller.” The movie was not nominated for an Academy Award that year. Instead, Mr. Kubrick earned the first Golden Raspberry for worst director.

Despite that, the film’s blood-drenched imagery and taut editing inspired future generations of directors, including Joel and Ethan Coen and Tim Burton. It is why, too, the movie is one of the films added this month to the National Film Registry for having cultural, historical and aesthetic significance in American film history.

Oscar season is around the corner. But while the Oscars reflect what the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences believes is important to culture now, the registry celebrates movies that make a lasting impression. Films have to be 10 years old to be nominated by the public or recommended by members of the National Film Preservation Board. Only 25 films are added each year. Some date back to the 1800s, are experimental or only seconds long.
