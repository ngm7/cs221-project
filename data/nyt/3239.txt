If audiences outside the Middle East have never heard of the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, her latest feature might change that.



That poignant drama, “Capernaum,” follows a boy who runs away and winds up roaming the slums of Beirut shouldering a distressing responsibility.

At its premiere at Cannes in May, the film received a 15-minute standing ovation and went on to win the Jury Prize, one of many honors on the festival circuit. This month it secured a Golden Globe nomination for best foreign-language film, paving the way for a potential Oscar nomination in the same category. And the critic A.O. Scott of The Times named it one of the 10 best movies of the year, writing that “Labaki refuses to lose sight of the exuberance, grit and humor that people hold onto even in moments of the greatest desperation.”

Much like Labaki’s past movies, “Caramel” and “Where Do We Go Now?,” “Capernaum” features a cast of mostly nonprofessional actors, and tackles societal ills. But it stands out as a cautionary tale. And critics have been in awe of its young stars: Zain al Rafeea, a 12-year-old Syrian refugee, and Boluwatife Treasure Bankole, an impressive baby girl cast as a boy.
