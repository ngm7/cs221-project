The most high-profile brand reinvention experiment in 21st-century American fashion came to a crashing halt last Friday when Calvin Klein announced it was parting ways with its chief creative officer, Raf Simons, “after Calvin Klein, Inc. decided on a new brand direction which differs from Simons’s creative vision.”

The departure of the Belgian designer, who won three awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in only two years, comes just over six months before his contract was due for renewal, and is effective immediately. There will be no Calvin Klein show during the upcoming New York Fashion Week, and there was no time frame given for when a successor would be named.

“It’s very sad, and unfortunate,” said Ken Downing, the fashion director for Neiman Marcus. It “began as a brilliant fashion moment with great promise. Raf Simons at Calvin Klein brought great excitement to the New York fashion scene and New York Fashion Week.”

The decision casts a shadow not only on the Calvin Klein business, but also on the growing belief in the fashion world that for a brand to be successful, it must hand all power over to a single creative who is empowered to impose his or her vision throughout.
