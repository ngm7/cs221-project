Marriage proposal stories submitted to The New York Times’s Society News Desk in 2018 ranged from spontaneous to well-scripted, though the jumbled manner in which a man from Illinois went about asking the love of his life to be his wife was truly puzzling.

Proposal getaways were a popular theme this year, with three fevered pitches from the heart originating in New York and landing successfully in Jamaica, Paris and Utah, while another positively picturesque proposal was popped on location in Italy.

One prospective groom relied not on a best man but on 10 of man’s best friends to deliver the question on a different mode of transportation, asking his significant other, “will you marry me,” midway through a dog-sled ride along a snowy trail in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

Not every proposal went according to plan, like the one in New Orleans tied to the start of the Second Avenue subway in New York, and another in the city that never sleeps, where a late-arriving ring-bearer burst into his bedroom only to find his future bride half-dressed and getting ready for bed.
