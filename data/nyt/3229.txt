This theater, for this city. New York City Center Theater celebrated its 75th anniversary last week. That milestone neatly coincided with the annual five-week Christmas season of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the theater’s first resident modern dance company, itself celebrating an anniversary this year: its 60th.

Now, as ever, the Ailey company is facing in multiple directions: reviving home repertory, acquiring works from elsewhere, commissioning new pieces. On Dec. 7, it presented the American premiere of “Kairos” (2014), by the British choreographer Wayne McGregor; and on Wednesday it presented a new “Timeless Ailey” retrospective (which is to tour 21 American cities), with excerpts from 14 works that Ailey made from 1958 to ’88.

For City Center’s anniversary on Tuesday, the company showed a triple bill of works by great American choreographers: Ailey’s own classic “Revelations” was preceded by Paul Taylor’s “Piazzolla Caldera” (1997) and Twyla Tharp’s “The Golden Section” (1983). Taylor-Tharp-Ailey: a world-conquering trio.

The Taylor “Caldera” — first acquired by the Ailey company in 2015 — is always a big hit, but I confess to having an allergy to it. I don’t enjoy its sexed-up treatment of tango, with women flaunting their underwear and dancers of both sexes steamily stroking their thighs. On Tuesday, though, I was struck by Taylor’s sheer brilliance in construction. He usually combines men and women in uneven numbers, in continual suspense; and his mastery of changing geometries is another way in which he keeps surprising you.
