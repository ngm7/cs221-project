ARTS & LEISURE

The cover photo illustration last Sunday omitted the name of the dancer featured. He is Taylor Stanley of New York City Ballet.

TRAVEL

Because of an editing error, the Q. and A. column last Sunday, about the comic actor Billy Eichner, misstated the location of Provincetown, one of Mr. Eichner’s favorite vacation spots. It is in Massachusetts, not Rhode Island.

MAGAZINE

An article on Nov. 25 about the director Yorgos Lanthimos misstated Lanthimos’s relationship with the ad agency where he met Efthimis Filippou, a playwright and co-writer on four of Lanthimos’s films. Lanthimos did not work for the agency.

BOOK REVIEW

A review on Dec. 2 about “My Big Wimmelbook,” a series of large-format board books, misspelled the surname of one of the authors. He is Max Walther, not Walth. The review also misstated the publishing history of the series. The volumes published in the United States this year are new books; they were not “originally published in Germany.”
