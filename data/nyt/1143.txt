Merriment was in the air on the fall runways with eyes glittering with metallics at Marc Jacobs and Jill Stuart, gold leaf at Akris and crystals at Kate Spade. With all the sparkle, it was easy to imagine the models all partying together at a splashy holiday bash.

Fast forward several months, and we’ve figured out how to bring that runway shine to looks you can wear during your in-real-life party season. The makeup artist Nick Barose, whose clients include Rachel Weisz, Lupita Nyong’o and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, is known for his surprising and pretty use of color and texture. Bottom line: We trust him on this topic.

“It’s about balance,” Mr. Barose said. “Think about makeup elements in terms of balanced levels of drama.” If the eyes are popping, the rest of the face should be less emphatic. Brows, which you may normally darken, might be filled in lighter than usual.

Mr. Barose is very clear, though, that balancing sparkly eyes does not mean nude lips. In fact, just no nude lips.
