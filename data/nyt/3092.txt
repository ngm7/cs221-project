Ingrid Laubrock: ‘Vogelfrei’

“Contemporary Chaos Practices: Two Works for Orchestra with Soloists” (Intakt)

This composer and saxophonist has been a regular in Anthony Braxton’s recent groups. On this set, Ms. Laubrock shows how thoroughly she has absorbed some of his lessons, by writing two works for orchestras stocked with talented improvisers. Even better than the solos is her writing for the larger forces — which, on “Vogelfrei,” include punchy percussion, frenzied strings and winds, an ethereal choir, and the pianist Kris Davis. (Yes, Ms. Davis again!) S.C.W.
