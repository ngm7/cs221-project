HONG KONG — The growing tensions over trade between the United States and China temporarily eased after a meeting between President Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, earlier this month. But at the same time distrust between the two countries, and now Canada, has escalated over the detentions of a leading Chinese executive in Canada and two Canadians in China.

Here is a look at the recent rise in trans-Pacific tensions, and what could happen next.

A trade dispute deferred

Mr. Trump has confronted China over its trade practices, and the United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year. China retaliated with its own tariffs on a range of American imports.

The escalating tariffs brought ties between the two countries to one of their lowest points in recent years, but at their meeting in Buenos Aires during the Group of 20 summit meeting, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi agreed to a truce. The United States would delay a tariff increase on $200 billion worth of goods set for Jan. 1 while the two sides negotiated a more permanent deal, with a March 1 deadline.

China also agreed to lift barriers on cars, food and fuel from the United States and has increased imports of some products, including soybeans. But China has tried to balance its softer approach on trade with fierce criticism of the detention of one of its top tech executives, events that have unfolded almost simultaneously.
