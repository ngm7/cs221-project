But after several victories, Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had never held elected office, has been bogged down by battles with the Legislature. New Jersey’s Assembly and Senate are controlled by Democrats, but the governor has few allies among lawmakers and has often been viewed as disengaged from the give-and-take that typically greases legislative gears.

In his first 100 days, Mr. Murphy signed into law measures on gun control, equal pay and tuition assistance for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. He also increased funding for Planned Parenthood and expanded voter rights.

“We have governed exactly as we said we would and we are exactly who we said we would be,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview.

But the governor’s progress has stalled on issues such as legalizing marijuana and increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and he was unable to pass his complete package of tax hikes in the budget.
