Most people facing trial hunker down and keep quiet, afraid that speaking out might anger the judge or result in their words being used against them in court.

Keeping quiet does not appear to be Harvey Weinstein’s strategy.

“I’ve had one hell of a year,” began an email Mr. Weinstein wrote on Monday from his personal email address. “The worst nightmare of my life.”

The message, which went on to criticize police investigators, quickly leaked out in Hollywood, drawing a torrent of outrage from women who have accused Mr. Weinstein of harassment or assault, and from many others.

His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the email had been sent by Mr. Weinstein to several close friends, and was not part of any legal strategy. But whoever the intended audience was, it dovetailed with his team’s aggressive push to get Mr. Weinstein’s side of the story into the public conversation at a delicate time, as the criminal case against him is fraying.
