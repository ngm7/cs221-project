A controversial format change for the World Cup instituted by FIBA, basketball’s world governing body, has forced 80 countries to compete for the 31 open slots in the field alongside the tournament host, China, via regional qualifying. It is similar to how the soccer World Cup entrants are decided.

Two-thirds of the qualifying games, however, clash with the N.B.A. schedule. Unlike their soccer counterparts around the world, who are released to their national teams for qualifying matches via what are known as “international breaks,” N.B.A. players and the majority of Euroleague players are not allowed to leave their teams during the season to represent their respective countries.

In Slovenia’s case, that has meant no Doncic, no Goran Dragic of the Miami Heat and the need for a new coach. Phoenix Suns Coach Igor Kokoskov had to surrender his Slovenia post once he took the Suns’ job.

The United States also did not receive an automatic berth for the 2019 World Cup as part of the new format — not even as the defending World Cup champion and reigning Olympic champion. But the Americans clinched a spot with a victory Sunday in Uruguay under Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has posted an 8-2 record in qualifying, relying mostly on players from the N.B.A.’s developmental G League.

Thanks to the efforts of Van Gundy and the 46 players he has used in qualifying thus far, USA Basketball will be able to send its usual squad of N.B.A. All-Stars to China under San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who has replaced Duke University’s Mike Krzyzewski as the full-time national team coach.
