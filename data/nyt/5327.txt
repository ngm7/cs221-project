A Four-Bedroom Villa in Costa Rica’s Central Valley

$1.65 MILLION

This custom-built, four-bedroom home is in a gated community in the small town of Brasil de Mora, about 10 miles west of Costa Rica’s capital city of San José, in the nation’s Central Valley.

Built into a hillside in 2005, the three-level, 5,200-square-foot home is constructed of cement in a modern geometric style accented with metal, wood and glass features. It is designed in a U-shape, with a garden courtyard in the center adjoined by two covered terraces and an in-ground lap pool. The two wings are connected by a central hallway fronted by a two-story glass wall overlooking the courtyard, as well as by a wooden stairway suspended on metal cables. An electric awning extends to shade the glass facade and the rooms behind it, according to Wijbrand Tuinstra, a sales associate with Sotheby’s International Realty, which has the listing.

The current owner employs a full-time gardener to tend to the 0.82-acre property’s extensive botanical gardens, which attract a wide variety of butterflies and birds, Mr. Tuinstra said.

“This is a very modern-inspired house, but adapted to its environment, with the enormous glass wall along the stairs and lots of windows looking out,” he said. “It’s quite unusual for Costa Rica.”
