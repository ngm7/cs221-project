When Saba Arain arrived in New York from Pakistan in 2009, she left behind a teaching career and a large family. The only person she knew in the city was her husband.

“I was crying all the time,” said Ms. Arain, 45. “I missed my family, especially my mom.”

About a year later, after giving birth to a son, Ms. Arain was ready to start teaching again. They had a family now, and she wanted to contribute. “I wanted to work,” she said in an interview this fall.

In Pakistan, Ms. Arain had taught kindergarten and then high school physics in Sindh Province. But when she tried to find a teaching job in New York, she was told that her English was not good enough.

“We are educated. We have degrees. But with a language problem, no one will accept my degree,” Ms. Arain said. “Nobody gives you a chance if your English is not good. If you can’t speak it or don’t understand it, how will they give it to you?”
