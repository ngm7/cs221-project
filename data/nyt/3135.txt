BE WITH

By Forrest Gander

This year, the term “political poetry” rightly reverberates with new excitement. In the midst of national turmoil, poets feel charged with speaking to our endangered polis; with urging us to feel, act and empathize; with calling us back to the spaces where words reveal worlds. Yet in other ways, the very term “political poetry” misleads, suggesting a terrain of poetry that could somehow be circumscribed, as if we could ever know where that realm “the political” begins or ends.

Against this landscape, Forrest Gander’s plangent, thrumming recent collection “Be With” — a book that probes, among other things, the sudden death of Gander’s wife, the celebrated poet C. D. Wright — explores a related question: How do we know where we ourselves begin or end? In many ways, the book’s focus is strikingly inward, showing how grief sounds in the body, mapping paths, making previously hidden regions visible. In another sense, Gander’s poems are public howls that trace a luminous borderland where the self dissolves into the world. The book’s epigraph tackles this friction head-on: “The political begins in intimacy.”

The collection also begins in intimacy. It opens with “Son,” a poem about Wright addressed to their son, which includes this acid sentence:

Why

say anything about death, inevitability, how

the body comes to deploy the myriad worm



as if it were a manageable concept not

searing exquisite singularity.

Gander then splits this singularity open: “and through my guts / writhe helminth parasites. Who was ever only themselves?” Suddenly the self is as plural as the many worms that will eventually consume it.
