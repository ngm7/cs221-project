Donning his public advocate hat, he plans to call attention to the performance of the city’s 311 complaint line by releasing data about response times at various city agencies, and the number of calls it takes to get a problem corrected. Then, as City Council speaker, he will hold hearings about the 311 data.

He said he plans to add interactive maps, created by the Council’s data team, to the public advocate’s website to help pair students with schools. He has scheduled a survey of subway riders — online and in person — and will be making appearances at train stations in all five boroughs to query passengers over five days in January.

The subject of mayoral control of the subways, he said, may come up. Mr. Johnson, in an interview, compared the idea to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s successful effort to control the city’s public schools in 2002.

Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, said the proposal was nothing new. “Lots of people have fantasized over it through the years — and with good reason,” he said. “The mayor doesn’t oppose the conversation, he’s just more focused on things that will help the subways now.”

Mr. Johnson’s eagerness to seize his additional clout is perhaps no surprise: For much of his first year as Council speaker, he has unabashedly embraced the spotlight while leading a body that is itching to assert its power vis-à-vis the mayor.

A recent cover of City and State, a New York political magazine, asked the pointed question: “Is Corey Johnson Already Mayor?” (Aides to the mayor chafed at the headline.)

Mr. Phillips dismissed the attention Mr. Johnson’s temporary role is likely to garner. “We’ve got a big city to run and I don’t think anyone paid any attention to it, to be honest,” Mr. Phillips wrote in an email, referring to the article in City and State. “But it sounds like a great story for him.”
