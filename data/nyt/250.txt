Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.

On this weekend’s cover of T: The New York Times Style Magazine are two luminaries of contemporary literature. They are ensconced in the wooden shelves and stacks of texts of the Othmer Library at the Brooklyn Historical Society. And they are very well-dressed. But just who exactly you are looking at, well, depends. There are four different covers.

It’s a split run, or split copy: different versions of a New York Times print product distributed throughout the country. It is the fourth time this year that T has run more than one cover image. The photo shoot, directed by Boots Riley, is paired with an essay by Ayana Mathis on the variety and resonance of black male voices in American letters, and it is anchored by a two-page spread — or “reveal,” in magazine parlance. For 30 playwrights, poets and novelists assembled in a stately library by a revered underground M.C.-turned-filmmaker, one cover simply would not do.

“It calls out for it,” said Minju Pak, the executive managing editor of T. “It is a group shot, and you do not want to put just one of them on the cover. You want to show the space as well.”
