Re “Yes, Jury Selection Is Racist” (Op-Ed, Dec. 6):

Ronald Wright ’s important research on the role of peremptory challenges in the jury selection process in North Carolina is welcome but not surprising. Indeed, peremptory challenges are a vehicle for racial bias.

This finding reinforces my jury-selection research started more than 40 years ago in Suffolk County, Mass. My research revealed that in both civil and criminal cases the jury-selection-process methodology discriminated against African-Americans, women and young people.

Thus, each jury pool vastly underrepresented these groups, further worsened by the use of peremptory challenges. Clearly the jury-selection process remains in dire need of reform throughout the country.
