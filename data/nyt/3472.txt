To the Editor:

“‘Broken’ System Lets Doctors Omit Industry Ties in Journals” (front page, Dec. 9) describes some welcome actions taken by institutions, professional organizations and journal editors to review and disclose previously unreported financial conflicts and to prevent future nondisclosures.

But the article doesn’t mention a critical ethical imperative: the need for research subjects to be fully informed about any relevant institutional and investigator financial interests before deciding on whether to enroll in a study.

Federal regulations require that institutional review boards must conduct prospective ethical review of studies, including approval of informed-consent language, before studies can begin. The Department of Health and Human Services has published guidance for institutions, the review boards and investigators on dealing with financial relationships and interests in research.

In addition to submission of conflict-of-interest forms, journal editors require authors to provide assurance of board review to document that studies were conducted ethically. Without full financial disclosure to research subjects, this will not occur.
