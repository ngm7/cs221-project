Tesla added Larry Ellison, executive chairman and founder of the software giant Oracle, and a senior executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance to its board of directors, fulfilling a key provision of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The board added Mr. Ellison, who bought three million shares of Tesla stock earlier this year, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who is in charge of human resources at Walgreens Boots Alliance, as independent directors on Thursday, the company said in a securities filing on Friday.

Tesla stock closed up 5.6 percent on Friday after the company announced the appointments.

In September, the S.E.C. required Tesla to add two independent board members and an independent chairman to settle a securities fraud lawsuit the commission brought against the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk. Securities regulators brought the case after Mr. Musk said that he had secured funding for a private buyout of the company in August.

In November, Tesla named Robyn M. Denholm chairwoman after Mr. Musk stepped down from that role, another requirement of the settlement. Ms. Denholm was the chief financial officer of Telstra, the dominant telecommunications company in Australia.
