LAS VEGAS — Late last season, as his Atlanta Braves surged to a division crown nobody else seemed to want, Manager Brian Snitker took pride in the youthful buzz throughout his dugout.

“It was like an American Legion team — the energy, the excitement, pulling for each other, caring about each other,” he said. “It’s a team that the city should be excited about watching because they’re very entertaining.”

It was not quite like this for their division rivals in Washington, New York, Philadelphia and Miami. The Nationals flopped in Bryce Harper’s final season before free agency. The Mets teased their fans with a fast start, then quickly faded. The Phillies fell apart down the stretch. The Marlins finished last, as expected, but Snitker figured the others would act quickly to rebound.

“When the playoffs were over,” said Snitker, whose team lost a division series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, “I was sitting around like, ‘Those other teams aren’t going to sit on their thumbs all winter. They’re going to get better, they’re going to do things to improve their clubs.’ And us included.”
