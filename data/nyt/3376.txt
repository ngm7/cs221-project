When Fred Goldring began thinking of his oldest daughter’s wedding day, he knew a simple gift wouldn’t do. Mr. Goldring, who is a former entertainment lawyer and musician in Pacific Palisades, Calif., had always dreamed of performing a song on his daughter’s wedding day. While his daughter Jenna Goldring, 28, was planning her dream wedding to Nikola Lahcanski on Sept. 15 at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles, he was writing a song that he planned to perform as a surprise on her wedding day.

“I had always dreamed of performing a song for both of my daughters at their weddings, but I had never really thought about what song that would be,” Mr. Goldring said.

Shortly after his daughter’s engagement, Mr. Goldring began to think of how he would make that dream a reality. He spent weeks searching online for “songs that dads sing to their daughters at their wedding,” but none captured what he really felt in his heart. A couple days later he picked up his guitar and in an hour he had written, “On Your Wedding Day.”

He still had one critic to win over: his wife.

“When I told my wife that I wanted to play an original song at Jenna’s wedding, she wasn’t exactly enthused,” Mr. Goldring said. “Then I played her the song and she quickly changed her mind while crying like a baby.”
