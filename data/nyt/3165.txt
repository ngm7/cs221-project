PARIS — The French rapper Médine often compares his music to boxing: In a career spanning 15 years, he has thrown countless hooks and barbs.

His two favorite targets, the political far-right and religious fundamentalists, have punched back. Médine, who is Muslim, has received death threats from right-wing activists, and in 2015, he found out that he was on an ISIS kill list.

The blow he received in September knocked him out for weeks.

After months of outrage from far-right activists, who started a petition accusing Médine of “singing violent lyrics in the name of Islam,” the rapper canceled two concerts at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris that were supposed to be the pinnacle of his current tour of France.

The Bataclan has become a hallowed site to many in France, after 90 people were killed there in a terrorist attack in 2015; opponents called the invitation for Médine to perform there an “indecency.” The rapper said he wanted to avoid demonstrations against the show out of respect for the victims’ families.
