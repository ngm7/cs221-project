Many of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren’t particularly holiday-focused.

We dug up 10 of those reviews from our archives, which we’ve rounded up here, along with info on where to stream them. Below is how the critic Vincent Canby reviewed “Scrooged” for The New York Times on Nov. 23, 1988:

Locked deep inside Bill Murray there is a small, hyperactive misanthrope fighting to be heard through the large heavy body that contains him. The misanthrope never sleeps. He’s a busy demon, peering out through Mr. Murray’s squinty eyes, seeing all and remaining actively unimpressed. By the time his nastiest observations fight their way to the surface, however, much of their sting has been absorbed by flesh, leaving a sometimes revivifying but thoroughly domesticated skepticism.

Because Mr. Murray is funniest when the big, laid-back, good-natured slob gives in to the furious mini-misanthrope, “Scrooged,” an updated variation on Dickens’s “Christmas Carol,” is best when Mr. Murray is allowed to be his secret self.

As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray’s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he’s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly. This may well be the secret of Mr. Murray’s enormous popularity in a series of similarly second-rate comedies, including “Ghostbusters.” In the end Mr. Murray must always deny what has appeared to be, until then, his redeeming offensiveness.
