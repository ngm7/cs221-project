In the era of Google Maps, one might be tempted to believe that there are no undiscovered corners of the Earth.

But a cave with an opening that can accommodate the Statue of Liberty, and a roaring river running through it, has been discovered in a remote area of British Columbia in Wells Gray Provincial Park, about 280 miles northeast of Vancouver.

“As far as North America goes, this is a honking big cave,” said John Pollack, a career caver and governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, which last week announced the cave’s existence.

“It’s one of the biggest in Canada,” he said, “and certainly one of the most spectacular.”

The cave was discovered in early spring when a group of biologists and researchers conducting a mountain caribou census first noticed what looked like a black hole on the snow-covered slope.
