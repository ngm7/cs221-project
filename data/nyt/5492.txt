For at least half a decade, a handful of beauty ingredients and treatments have reigned supreme: retinol, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, microdermabrasion, lasers. Wendy Ouriel, the creator of the Los Angeles-based organic skin-care line Oumere — an amalgamation of her surname and “telomere,” the compound at the end of chromosomes that prevents DNA strands from unraveling — takes issue with all of the above. A trained cellular biologist, Ouriel believes the treatments to be damaging on the cellular level — and what is aging if not the accumulation of cellular damage over time? Since launching her brand in 2016, and her blog, Bioluminescence, a year later, she’s become a sort of skin-care renegade, amassing a devoted fan base that includes China Chow and the artist Katerina Jebb. Dover Street Market recently stocked Oumere, which is also available at Sally Hershberger, for its new store in downtown L.A.

What Ouriel is promising, essentially, is expertise. Most product formulators are not biologists but cosmetic chemists who, she tells me, might know how ingredients will react with each other but not necessarily how they will react with the skin. “It’s like having a cotton farmer design your clothes,” she says. After speaking with Ouriel, I rid myself of several long-neglected serums in my medicine cabinet, no longer convinced of their untapped powers, and attempted to make a real routine out of her five-product line, which includes an oil-based cleanser, a gentle chemical exfoliant, a pigment-correcting eye serum, a UV-protecting serum and a moisture-locking serum, and comes in handmade glass beakers with red rubber-capped pipettes. It’s a mad-scientist aesthetic that is meant for more than just marketing. Glass is nonreactive, for one, and the breakable material ensures a degree of mindfulness from users. “You have to treat it with care, just like you should treat your skin,” she says. “This is not something you can just throw into a gym bag.”
