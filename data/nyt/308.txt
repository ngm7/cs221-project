The year has nearly come to an end, which means it’s a good time for reflection and to catch up on some reading.

The bevy of black male writers pictured above are celebrated in a new cover story by T Magazine. What’s interesting about the feature is how it uses America’s current obsession with black male authors to raise questions about the visibility of their female peers. To mitigate this tension, the men in the piece were asked to recommend their favorite black American female author.

In recent weeks, you have sent me some worthy recommendations as well.

Edward Ball’s “Slaves in the Family,” about the author’s slave-owner ancestors, appeared in multiple letters. “He was so forthright in his concrete attempts to make amends for his family’s slave-trading history,” wrote Phoebe Grigg of San Francisco. “A lot of my unformed feelings were identified and smoked out, and I am much the better for it.”

Frances Araujo recommended Countee Cullen, a Harlem Renaissance poet, whose work exposed her to race for the first time. “It’s short and brutal. And I, a little white girl, have never forgotten the chill of sadness,” she wrote. She also mentioned “Silver Pennies,” a collection of poems for young boys and girls by Blanche Jennings Thompson.
