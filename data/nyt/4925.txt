The Amenities

In addition to the restaurant and bar on the top floor, thereâ€™s a small swimming pool on an outdoor deck facing the mountains. Nearby, the gym features garage doors that can be rolled up. On the second level, the market hall holds retail kiosks and stalls from local brands such as Winter Session, a maker of handbags, and Vinyl Me, Please, dealing records, as well as boutiques and a local outpost of a Montreal art gallery.

The Bottom line

Though the industrial design can feel a little chilly at the Source, it is warmed by the many locals drawn to this social magnet for food, drink and shopping.
