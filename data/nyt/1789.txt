MONDAY PUZZLE — The only nice thing about winter, as far as I’m concerned, is that these are the months when the gardening catalogs arrive in the mail. The bone-chilling cold is held at bay by dreams of what I will plant in the spring, as I flick through pages of greenery over mugs of hot coffee.

Should I plant all vegetables, or should I leave room for some tasty herbs? Is this the year I finally put in that fig tree I’ve coveted? The answers are still months away and, as the weather warms up, my only wish is that I will be able to stand in the middle of my little plot of land and watch it thicken.

Wait, what?

That’s not the phrase I would normally use to describe my gardening adventures, but it is a hint to cracking Alex Eylar’s puzzle.
