Ricardo Barber, a stage actor who left Cuba after spending time in a forced-labor camp during Fidel Castro’s rule and became a core member of the Spanish-language troupe Repertorio Español in New York, died on Dec. 17 in Manhattan. He was 81.

The company announced his death. No cause was given.

Mr. Barber was establishing himself as an actor in Havana when Castro came to power in 1959 in a Communist revolution that was hostile to many things, including homosexuality. Mr. Barber was gay, and in the late 1960s he was placed in one of Castro’s “military units to aid production,” the agricultural labor camps known by the Spanish acronym UMAP, which were, as The New York Times put it in 1974, “for petty criminals, homosexuals, ‘pre-delinquents’ and other ‘potential dissenters’ — people who were not guilty of any wrongdoing, but had been sent to the camps because of their ‘attitude.’ ”

The camps were abolished after a few years, but the experience changed Mr. Barber’s feelings toward his country.

“I wasn’t the same,” he told The Times in 1998, when he and other Repertorio actors made an emotional return trip to Cuba. “I no longer believed in the revolution, and I began to see the bad in everything.”
