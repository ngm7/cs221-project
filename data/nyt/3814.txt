Oribe Canales, a celebrity hairdresser who worked, and palled around, with models like Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista in the era of big hair and fat shoulder pads, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 62.

Mr. Canales, who lived in Miami, suffered liver and kidney failure in a hospital after going to New York for cancer treatment last month, his husband, Zaki Amin, said.

In the late 1980s and early ′90s, Mr. Canales, known professionally as simply Oribe (pronounced OR-bay), worked closely with the makeup artist François Nars, the photographer Steven Meisel and the stylist Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele in helping to build the careers of many women who became known as supermodels, giving them a look, emblematic of the era, that was heightened by dramatic makeup and hair to match.

“The type of hair that Oribe adored was super high-maintenance,” Ms. Crawford said in a telephone interview on Monday. “It worked in the late ′80s and early ′90s, where more was more, and the shoulder pads were huge and the hair was big. It was beautiful, but it was definitely all about the hair.
