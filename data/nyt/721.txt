Big ambitions require investment, but not all infusions of capital are equal. Cronos, the Canadian pot producer, is in early talks with the tobacco giant Altria, Reuters reported on Monday. An association with a huge tobacco company isn’t exactly what this nascent industry needs.

To say that Cronos has expansion plans is an understatement. It wants to grow its production of weed to more than 258,000 pounds a year — equivalent to just less than $900 million a year in revenue terms, based on its latest realized price per ounce.

In the last quarter it sold just 1,133 pounds. That’s not to say that the Cronos chief executive Michael Gorenstein can’t hit that target — but anyone buying his company’s shares, or those of equally driven rivals, is effectively getting some greenhouses and nurseries, supply agreements and a lot of hope.
