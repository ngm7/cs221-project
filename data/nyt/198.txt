“I still can’t believe I’m in America,” said Mr. Ahmad, 36, who was trained as an actor in Syria before seeking asylum in Britain, where all three men live now. “It’s bizarre that we live at a time when you need all this work to get one person to another country, and amazing that it happened. But I also feel very privileged, because every day I’m here, I think about the millions of people who can’t go from one place to another.”

“The Jungle,” cast intact, will start performances Tuesday in anticipation of a Dec. 9 opening at St. Ann’s Warehouse, a prestigious and globally minded nonprofit theater on the Brooklyn waterfront. The show has an immersive set — audience members sit in a replica of an Afghan cafe at the camp, and post-show performances and talks will be held in the same geodesic dome that was used by the show’s writers, Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, when they established the Good Chance Theater at the camp in 2015. The play is scheduled to run for eight weeks, which will make it the longest-running show in the theater’s history.

Mr. Ghobsheh, a 23-year-old songwriter and musician who is now using the first name Milan, and Mr. Moradi, a 26-year-old kung fu practitioner who competed on the Iranian national team, were both discovered by the theater in the Calais camp, known as the Jungle. Mr. Moradi, who is Kurdish and said he fled Iran because it had become increasingly difficult for his people, started teaching kung fu to other refugees in the Jungle, and then began performing as an actor. He said he believes in the power of the play. “I think it is going to be helpful to show our story,” he said.
