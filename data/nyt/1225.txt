On the novel’s 80th anniversary in 1923, The Times called it “the greatest little book in the world.”

In an essay for The New York Times on Dec. 24, 1933, Dickens’s son Henry discussed what Christmas meant to his father and described how the family celebrated the holiday: “There was usually a long walk with the dogs on the afternoon of Christmas Day; and the festivities in the evening, varied as they were, were typical of the time; that is to say, they were all brightened by good humor and high spirits. Sometimes there would be a charade; sometimes games, of which he was particularly fond; sometimes a country dance with the servants brought in to take their part. All this time Charles Dickens was the life and soul of the party. As he did in everything else, he threw his heart into it. His merriment was no mere pretense; his laughter bubbled over and was contagious; his buoyancy was immense; and there was not a soul present who did not become infected with the same feeling of genuine happiness.”
