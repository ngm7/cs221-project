It’s hard for a conductor not to make an impression with the surefire opening of Verdi’s “Otello.” The terrified people of Cyprus look out to sea where a vicious storm is battering the ship carrying home Otello, their governor. The orchestra captures the sounds of crackling thunder and roiling waves; chorus members erupt with cries of fear as they see the ship tottering.

Gustavo Dudamel, one of the most dynamic conductors of our time and, arguably, at 37, the face of classical music today, made the most of this scene in his much-anticipated debut at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday, when Bartlett Sher’s sleekly contemporary 2015 production returned to the house. The orchestra seethed and heaved with intensity. Slashing chords had raw, brassy power. Mr. Dudamel kept the scattered choral declamation and fitful orchestral stretches in sync, while making the episode seem utterly spontaneous. And when the full chorus breaks into a collective appeal to God to save the ship, Mr. Dudamel pulled back the tempo to give more lyrical fullness to the pleading melodic line.

From the compelling way he handled this stormy opening it seemed like we were in good hands. Mr. Dudamel came through, leading a surely paced, textured and exciting performance of a challenging score. If there were no interpretive revelations — and, for me, a couple of scenes that lacked tragic weight — this was still a significant, and overdue, debut.

Though Mr. Dudamel is best known for his visionary leadership at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he has actually conducted quite a bit of opera, including appearances at La Scala, the Berlin State Opera and the Paris Opera. And he’s innovatively presented operas at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
