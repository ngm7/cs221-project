It looked as if JuJu Smith-Schuster had made yet another critical catch in a season full of them for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

With his team trailing the New Orleans Saints by three points in the final minute, Smith-Schuster, a second-year receiver, made a catch that put his team in field goal position — but the ball popped loose as he was wrapped up by Sheldon Rankins, and the Saints recovered.

The uncharacteristic mistake by Smith-Schuster could scarcely have been more costly. It gave the Saints a 31-28 win at home, and it knocked the Steelers out of the top spot in the A.F.C. North and, at least temporarily, out of the playoff picture.

It also secured home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Saints, who prevailed on a night when they were far from their best — one great drive by the offense in the fourth quarter, aided by a pass-interference penalty on a fourth-down incompletion, was enough to earn the win.
