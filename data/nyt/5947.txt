You might groan at the name, A Midwinter Night’s Dram, but pour some anyway. This rye whiskey is strong and spicy on the palate, with aromas of cinnamon, cloves, honey and vanilla. It’s made by High West, a distillery in Utah’s Park City ski country. To produce it, the company ages its blended Rendezvous Rye in French oak barrels once used for port. Drink it neat or add it to a cup of hot Earl Grey tea.

A Midwinter Night’s Dram, $125 for 750 milliliters at Union Square Wines & Spirits, unionsquarewines.com, and Winfield-Flynn Wines & Spirits, winfieldflynn.com; highwest.com.
