Pop Music: Chris Thile With St. Vincent and Jon Batiste

Dec. 15 and 22; ticketmaster.com.

Yes, Chris Thile is based in New York City, and yes, he is the voice of the nation’s folksiest variety show. Since 2016, he’s been host of American Public Media’s “Live From Here,” a revamped version of “A Prairie Home Companion,” Garrison Keillor’s decades-long paean to storytelling and Midwestern values. But the dissonance dissolves when considering that Thile is a virtuoso mandolinist for the groups Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers.

For the month of December, Thile and his band, led by super-producer Mike Elizondo, have been broadcasting live weekly from Town Hall in Manhattan. The two remaining shows will star indie rock favorite St. Vincent and “The Late Show” bandleader Jon Batiste; and classical ensemble The Knights.

There are still stories told and winkingly political sketches performed, but those musical A-listers form the show’s core. Expect all the visiting artists to step outside their musical comfort zones. NATALIE WEINER
