Loic Gouzer, an irreverent maverick who led history-making sales of Leonardo da Vinci, Jean-Michel Basquiat and David Hockney, is stepping down as co-chairman of Christie’s Americas postwar and contemporary art at the end of this year, the auction house announced on Monday.

In a statement, Mr. Gouzer said that he would spend “the next few months concentrating on conservation and climate issues before coming back to the art world with a new project.”

The announcement marks the second major departure from the auction house; Francis Outred, Christie’s head of postwar and contemporary art in Europe, resigned last month. Mr. Gouzer’s exit leaves in charge his co-chairman, Alex Rotter, who came to Christie’s from Sotheby’s last year.

Guillaume Cerutti, Christie’s chief executive, said in the statement: “I wish Loic the very best with his future ventures.”
