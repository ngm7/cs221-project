For some, social media is a tool; for others, it’s a job; and for even more, it’s a door to a different world. But in “The American Meme,” the filmmaker Bert Marcus wants to frame it as a cracked mirror that reflects the worst in all of us.

The film follows social media celebrities like Josh Ostrovsky (known as the Fat Jew), Paris Hilton, the comedian Brittany Furlan, the photographer Kirill Bichutsky and others. It considers their rises to fame, their struggles to sustain their influence and their relationship to their own work. In doing so, Marcus has made a documentary that is not unlike the internet itself: maximalist and without focus. Marcus is keen on a scattershot approach, like having multiple tabs open, in making a nihilistic conclusion about how social media is a purgatory for the lonely. But his observations are facile despite the complexity the subject matter has to offer.
