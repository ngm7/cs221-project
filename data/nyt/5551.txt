CHASE BROCK EXPERIENCE at the Beckett Theater at Theater Row (Dec. 28-29, 8 p.m.; Dec. 30, 3 and 7 p.m.; Jan. 2-3, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 13). Brock plants his new piece, “The Girl With the Alkaline Eyes,” in a futuristic setting: a high-tech lab where Oliver, a young coder, is hard at work on a secret project related to artificial intelligence. (It’s all in the title.) In this 70-minute dance thriller, featuring a score and scenario by Eric Dietz, Brock explores the desire between a man and his machine.

TONY ORRICO at Signs and Symbols (Jan. 3, 6-8 p.m.; through Jan. 27). The gallery hosts “A Continued Gesture Towards Us,” a site-specific performance and exhibition in which Orrico, an artist and dancer, translates his movement practice into visual forms. His performative works — two-handed drawings as intricate and feathery as spiderwebs — create three-dimensional experiences in which he uses his body as a guide for measurement. For the first two weeks of the show, Orrico will turn the gallery space into his studio; in addition to graphite, he will work with rope, reclaimed wood, foam, glue and plaster. Opening night features a reception and a 90-minute session in which Orrico performs a drawing. It’s a fascinating sight.
