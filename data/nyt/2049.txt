That means some important City Council committees have no women on them, including technology, environmental protection, and parks and recreation.

“Our voice is completely missing from the Council’s oversight mission in these key areas,” said Carlina Rivera, a councilwoman from Manhattan. Another dozen committees only have one female member.

What’s new: The City Council’s Women’s Caucus, led by Ms. Rivera and Margaret S. Chin, is working to correct the imbalance.

For the first time, the caucus has hired an executive director paid out of the Council’s general budget rather than an individual lawmaker’s staff budget: Julie Kim, a former program manager at the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs.

“At a time when reproductive, immigrant and gender rights are being challenged every day, the work of the caucus needs to be felt throughout this city,” said Ms. Kim, who also founded the Asian American Feminist Collective. “My role is to be the person who is focused on gender equity at the City Council.”
