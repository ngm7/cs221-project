In the late 1800s, a Parisian pastry maker (legends dispute exactly who) created a new type of cake that paid tribute to the Christmas Eve tradition of the Yule log. It was a simple recipe: A rectangular sponge cake, spread with pastry cream, was rolled into a cylinder and coated in chocolate buttercream. It was then festooned with mushroom-shaped meringues and almond paste cut as leaves to resemble a wooden log freshly chopped from the forest.

To this day throughout France, the bûche de Noël remains the indispensable and highly anticipated final touch to a hearty holiday meal. It is also a favorite playground for pâtissiers to display their finest ideas and technical skills.

We interviewed s ome of France’s leading pastry chefs about the stories behind their Christmas creations. Their responses have been translated, condensed and edited.

We branded our bûches for over two decades in partnership with fashion designers, artists and architects, until we felt that creativity had taken the upper hand over flavor and the meaning of Christmas. We needed our bûche back, and as a log.
