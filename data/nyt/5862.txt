1. President Trump threatened to close the southern border and cut off aid to countries in Central America if Congress refuses to fund a wall.

The president’s threats came on the seventh day of a partial shutdown that has affected up to 800,000 government workers. Congress is not scheduled to take up the debate until after the new year. “We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall,” Mr. Trump tweeted.
