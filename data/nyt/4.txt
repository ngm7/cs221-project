George Bush, the 41st president of the United States, died on Friday at age 94, and the tributes and condolences quickly poured in online. From his family, including the 43rd president of the United States, to those who had disagreed with his politics, a surge of posts honored the man who served his country in more than 40 years of public service.

“After 94 remarkable years, our dear Dad has died,” former President George W. Bush said in a statement on behalf of his siblings. “George H.W. Bush was a man of the highest character and the best dad a son or daughter could ask for. The entire Bush family is deeply grateful for 41’s life and love, for the compassion of those who have cared and prayed for Dad, and for the condolences of our friends and fellow citizens.”
