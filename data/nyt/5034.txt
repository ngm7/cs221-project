A tent city in the Texas desert that came to symbolize the mass detention of migrant children by the Trump administration will most likely be closed within weeks.

An official with BCFS, the shelter operator that has been running the encampment in Tornillo, Tex., said late Sunday that the expectation was that by Jan. 15, all 2,500 children would be on their way to a parent or sponsor in the United States.

“By mid-January, the children should be all released,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak with the news media and spoke on condition of anonymity. “We’re not extending our contract with the government.”

The official said that BCFS’s contract would expire on Dec. 31, and that it would be extended daily until all the children have been released from the Tornillo shelter. Some children at Tornillo have been there since it opened in June, and minors at other shelters have been stuck for about a year.
