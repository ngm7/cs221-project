WASHINGTON — The challenge confronting the Federal Reserve as it meets this week is a tale of two economies. Wall Street investors are behaving as if the economic expansion is in grave danger, while the best available data show that the American economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace.

The disconnect is visible on other Wall Streets across the United States.

Dorice Soroka, who runs a small company at Wall Street and Myrtle Lane in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her revenue has finally reached the level she last saw in 2006. “And that was unhealthy growth,” Ms. Soroka said of the years before the crisis. “This is much more healthy.”

Peoples State Bank, on East Wall Street in Eagle River, Wis., also is prospering.

“Our market areas remain economically healthy,” said Scott M. Cattanach, the president of PSB Holdings, which operates nine branches in central and northern Wisconsin. The bank recently reported that profits rose 28 percent in the third quarter, and demand for development loans remained strong in the fourth quarter.

Katy Brooks, the president of the Bend, Ore., Chamber of Commerce — whose offices sit on Wall Street — said the region’s tech companies were trying to fill more than 400 vacancies.
