Paul Gregory was a stage, screen and television producer whose career flowered in what has been called the golden age of entertainment.

It was a time, in the 1950s and ’60s, when floodlights slid up and down facades along the Great White Way as limousines carrying women in gowns and men in tuxedos drew up beside squealing crowds to deposit their glamorous cargo under Broadway marquees announcing the names of Hollywood and international stars.

It was also a time when the stage, often showcasing dramas and musicals with social themes, was ripe for experimentation, much to Mr. Gregory’s liking. His productions were known for dispensing with props, costumes, scenery, orchestras and other conventions to spotlight the talent of stars and exploit the imagination of audiences.

But as that era flickered out, Mr. Gregory all but disappeared with it. And when he died at 95 on Christmas Day in 2015, little public notice was taken; his death went virtually unreported at the time.
