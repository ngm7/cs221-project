LOS ANGELES — When the long-awaited Academy Museum of Motion Pictures opens next year, it will offer a mix of scholarship and sparkle as it tries to appeal to two discordant audiences: moviedom’s elite and the tourist masses.

Kerry Brougher, the museum’s director, announced his programming strategy on Tuesday. The $388 million institution — its opening now pushed back to late 2019 — expects to attract about 860,000 visitors annually. It is next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and features a theater inside a spherical building designed by Renzo Piano that has been likened to the Death Star. (Piano prefers to think of it as a “soap bubble.”)

Anchoring the six-floor Academy Museum will be a 30,000-square-foot exhibition tracing the artistic and scientific history of cinema from a filmmaker’s perspective, starting in the late 1800s in France, and including an array of movie installations. Galleries will focus on early female directors, international silent film, Soviet cinema, the Hollywood studio system and Indian independent film, among other topics.
