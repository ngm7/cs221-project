I moved out of my parents’ house when I was 18. I headed off to college and with each passing year, grew older, became more self-reliant and hit new adult milestones, just as my parents had before me. Sure, some people might compare my mid-to-late 20s with my parents’ and say to me, “At your age, your parents had two children, a retirement fund and owned a house” and “You live in a walk-in closet,” but I think we all know the old saying: If you can’t touch every wall of your room while lying down, you’re spending too much on rent! Who needs a 401(k) when you have a Fitbit. Health is wealth. My Fitbit is still in the box but next year … next year is definitely the year I open it.

Even if it has been a slow crawl toward adulthood, I can confidently say that for 364 days out of the year, I am an independent grown-up. However, there’s an exception. One day a year, when I go home to visit my Greek family on Christmas.

As soon as I knock at the front door and listen for the traditional “She’s heeahh!!!” greeting, I comfortably, effortlessly and automatically become a child again. It’s the magic ritual of the holidays.

The Entrance

We all hug and shriek until I am taken on an in-depth tour of the house (that I grew up in). While everything looks untouched from 1998, my mom clarifies that “this drawer is just for hand towels now” and “the chair was moved to make room for the tree.” We stare at the tree for 25 minutes. I bathe in the glory of the full fridge. My mom points to every dish and says, “I made that one the way you like it.” She asks if I’ve been to the dentist. I have. She schedules an appointment anyway.
