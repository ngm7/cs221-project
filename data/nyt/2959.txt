To the Editor:

In “The Truth Inside the Wine” (Thursday Styles, Dec. 13), you refer to Vassar College as “a haven for worldly artistic kids who were too urban for Kenyon and Oberlin but didn’t have the grades or scores for Brown or Yale.”

As a teacher, I find these hierarchical categorizations incredibly unhealthy. We need to dispel such slipshod rankings held by many high school students and their families.

Vassar was my first choice for college, as it was for many of my peers, not because of what it or I lacked, but because of what it offered: bright and caring professors and small class sizes on a picturesque campus.

Thank you, Vassar.
