“We went with a 10-point tiebreak at six-games-all in the final set to ensure the fans still get a special finale to these often epic contests, with the longer tiebreak still then allowing for that one final twist or change of momentum in the contest,” Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said in a statement. “This longer tiebreak also can lessen some of the serving dominance that can prevail in the shorter tiebreak.”

The surge of reforms to Grand Slam match formats seems to have been spurred by the pair of marathon Wimbledon men’s singles semifinals in July. The first, between Kevin Anderson and John Isner, went to 26-24 in the fifth set and ended after 6 hours 36 minutes. The semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal that followed ended at 10-8 in the fifth set after 5 hours 15 minutes and needed an extra day to finish. Those enduring semifinals delayed the traditional start of the women’s final.

The tennis scoring system, often difficult for newcomers to the sport to learn, has never had so many variations. They could be seen as charming idiosyncrasies, like the changing court surfaces across the calendar, or as evidence of growing fractiousness in a sport whose governing bodies frequently fail to find consensus.

ATP Tour events are different still from Grand Slam tournaments, with all matches being played in a best-of-three-set format instead of the best-of-five format. And then there’s the Davis Cup, which is switching next year from best-of-five matches to best-of-three as part of a radical overhaul to the competition. Davis Cup introduced final-set tiebreakers for the first time in 2016.

The Australian Open will be the first tournament to use a 10-point tiebreaker in singles play. It has been frequently used in doubles, where it has replaced a full third set in doubles matches on the ATP and WTA tours, as well as in mixed doubles at the Grand Slam events outside of Wimbledon.
