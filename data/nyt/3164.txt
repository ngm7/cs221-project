Although Gimelstob avoided ouster by the board of directors, his position on the panel remains in doubt because the 10-member player council can still choose to vote him off with a simple majority. Novak Djokovic, the No. 1 men’s player, is the president of the player council, a group that recently demonstrated a willingness to remove board members.

In November, the council voted Roger Rasheed, a coach and former player, off the board after he voted in favor of a modest one-year pay increase from ATP tournaments, which infuriated many players. Those players preferred a more significant pay increase over a longer period of time. Egdes replaced Rasheed on an interim basis.

There is no other mechanism in the ATP rules for a suspension of a board member. The only methods are removal via the two vote options, or if he steps down.

Gimelstob, who was first elected to the ATP board in 2008, also serves as a coach for John Isner, the highest-ranked American man, and is a frequent contributor to Tennis Channel.

Tennis Channel said that it had granted Gimelstob time off during the court proceedings but it has given no other public indications about Gimelstob’s future at the network. Isner, who is also a member of the player council, has expressed support for Gimelstob and said he, too, would wait for all the facts to emerge.
