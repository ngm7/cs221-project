TOKYO â€” Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan Motor chairman, was arrested again by the Japanese authorities on Friday, this time on suspicion that he shifted more than $16 million in personal losses incurred a decade ago to the automaker.

The rearrest of Mr. Ghosn dealt a setback to his hopes for getting released from the Tokyo jail where he has been held for more than a month on different charges. It also adds to the legal problems of an executive who once oversaw a sprawling automotive global empire that sold more than 10 million cars last year.

The authorities rearrested Mr. Ghosn on suspicion of breach of trust related to a financial investment that tumbled in value during the 2008 global financial crisis, according to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK. The authorities said he had transferred the investment, a derivative contract, to Nissan from his personal asset management company.

If he were charged and found guilty of the new accusations, Mr. Ghosn could face up to 10 years in prison. His lawyer in Japan could not be immediately reached for comment.
