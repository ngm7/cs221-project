The news that a New Jersey golf course owned by President Trump, who has made border security and the fight to protect jobs for Americans a cornerstone of his presidency, had been employing undocumented immigrants as housekeepers was far from the first such revelation about a prominent public official.

Here are a few other cases that made national headlines.

Deported as a Child

When President Richard Nixon sought to make inroads among Latino voters in his re-election campaign, he nominated Romana Acosta Bañuelos, a Mexican-American woman, to be the treasurer of the United States, the official in charge of the nation’s currency. During her Senate confirmation in 1971, government agents raided the food company she had founded in Los Angeles and found immigrants working there who were undocumented.

Though the Mexican-American labor activist Cesar Chavez testified against Ms. Bañuelos on Capitol Hill, her nomination survived, and she went on to serve for about two years. Senators believed that she did not know about the undocumented workers and that the raid had been instigated to embarrass the White House.

Ms. Bañuelos, who was born in Arizona and had helped establish the first Latino-owned bank in California, had been deported as a child, when the government sent her family and more than a million other people of Mexican descent to Mexico because of job scarcity in the United States during the Great Depression.
