Coming Out to My Son

I said to my 12-year-old son, “You know how men and women date and marry, like I did with Dad before we split up?” He nodded. “Well,” I said, “I’m dating someone but not a man; I’m dating a woman.” He said, “Are you happy?” “Yes,” I said, “Very happy.” “Cool,” he said, “then I’m happy.” A few years later he walked me down the aisle to my soon-to-be wife. — Carrie Platner

We Fought It Together

Mom, my ex-nemesis, allowed me just one glass of wine with the high-protein, low-fiber dinners she would cook me. My defenses down, I was losing my hair and the old hostility. “I’d take your place if I could,” she said through tears one night as she tucked me in bed. My mother couldn’t bear to see me suffering and afraid, even though I wasn’t the daughter she expected me to be. And I couldn’t fight my mother and cancer at the same time. So we stopped fighting each other and fought my cancer together. — Page Leggett
