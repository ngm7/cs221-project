Whatever you do, don’t take the easy way out — that only brings temporary pleasure.

Also, stop comparing yourself to others. Thinking that other people are more successful because they are smarter, prettier or taller will only serve to undermine your own success. Keep in mind, however, that it is extremely helpful to have someone else to talk to, whether that person is a coach, a mentor or simply someone you respect who has been successful and is living a positive life.

When you’re being honest about your feelings, accept the fact that self-doubt is O.K. It’s a normal human reaction. The key is not to be driven by feelings of insecurity. In matches, I always tell myself that it’s O.K. to be nervous, but it’s not O.K. to let that nervousness impact my game.

I have often observed people around me make clearly misguided decisions, and then wondered in disbelief: “Why would they do such a thing?” At the time, their decisions seemed nonsensical. But I’ve come to realize that they were basing their choices on their feelings of self-doubt. When those decisions led to regrettable outcomes, it only underscored the idea that they weren’t worthy, reinforcing a negative cycle.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

2. Create a “map” of the path you will follow to achieve your goals.

You deserve success, happiness and the chance to live your dreams.

If believing all that seems difficult, try telling yourself this: “I deserve the worst things in life. I deserve failure and unhappiness.” Does this sound right? Of course not. Tell yourself the opposite — and go for it.

A study from Ohio State University provides evidence that people who can see themselves achieving their goals are more likely to do so. Once you can visualize yourself reaching your goals, create an action plan to get there.
