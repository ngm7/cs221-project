Good morning. For those raised under the Soviet regime in Russia, and for those in the diaspora that fled it, New Year’s Eve is an important holiday, the biggest holiday of the year. There was no Christmas under Soviet governance, no miracles to celebrate, but the passing of another year of successful revolution was heralded with state-approved concerts and celebrations. At home, those parties evolved and, soon enough, Grandfather Frost and his granddaughter the Snow Maiden made their appearance at them, handing out presents on the night of year’s end, dispensing cheer.

Julia Moskin traveled for The Times to Portland, Ore., to learn more about that, at the home of the chef Bonnie Frumkin Morales and her husband, Israel Morales, who own and operate the restaurants Kachka and Kachinka there. The couple celebrates New Year’s Eve with the Frumkin family, with a long, involved family meal that lasts well into the morning of Jan. 1.

This year, it might be fun to join them, at least in spirit. Julia scored amazing recipes that you could set up for this weekend, in advance of serving an incredible feast on Monday night.

So, this weekend, maybe make some no-bake crunchy chocolate cookies (above), essentially chocolate salami. You could as well shop in advance of making mushrooms and potatoes in cream. Likewise, an herb-flecked grain salad with mushrooms, hazelnuts and pears.
