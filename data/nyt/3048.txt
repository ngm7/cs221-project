This week’s issue of the Book Review trains its eye on the world of poetry — which is not as genteel as the caricature of it might suggest. In her cover essay, Tracy K. Smith, the United States poet laureate, writes that political poetry “has become a means of owning up to the complexity of our problems, of accepting the likelihood that even we the righteous might be implicated by or complicit in some facet of the very wrongs we decry. Poems willing to enter into this fraught space don’t merely stand on the bank calling out instructions on how or what to believe; they take us by the arm and walk us into the lake, wetting us with the muddied and the muddled, and sometimes even the holy.”

On this week’s podcast, Gregory Cowles, the Book Review’s poetry editor (as well as its senior editor), talks about the wide array of poets featured in the issue, as well as Smith’s centerpiece essay.

“I don’t mean to suggest that political poetry did not exist before the past several years. It has always existed,” Cowles says. “But the culture only tunes in sometimes, and it feels like that’s what’s happening with political poetry.”
