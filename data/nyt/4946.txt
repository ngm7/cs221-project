On Dec. 13, I took part in an annual Philadelphia running tradition: the South Philly Striders and Fishtown Beer Runners Holiday Lights Run, where a few hundred people run four miles through South Philadelphia to look at Christmas light displays. It’s a fun, slow going affair, where runners wear ridiculous holiday themed garb, dash over packed sidewalks, stop to gawk at inflatable Santas and take pictures with Christmas bears, all winding up at a bar big enough to hold everyone.

As I waited to walk into the bar, I saw wrist after wrist go up: people checking their GPS watches for their distance and time. “It wasn’t exactly four miles!” one said. “Yeah, I got 3.82 and I’m supposed to run four today. Should I go run a little bit more so I hit four?” asked another.

The holiday season is a busy time, with travel, family visits, upended schedules and sleighloads of treats and drinks. For most runners, running doesn’t stop, even if you’re just barely squeezing it in. As you’re reading this, I’m probably wrapping up my 10-mile run, which I started in the dark, so that I can shower, put my pajamas back on, and meet my visiting nephews for breakfast.
