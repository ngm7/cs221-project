WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi overwhelmingly won the Democratic nomination last month to be speaker, but the defection of 32 Democratic dissidents left her short of the votes she would need to win the gavel in January, when she can lose only 17.

In the weeks since, Ms. Pelosi — renowned for her ability to arm-twist and wheedle — has quietly campaigned to pick off members of the rebel faction, cutting deals and negotiating compromises to capture 218 pledges of support, and on Wednesday, she struck her most significant deal yet.

Here are some of the deals that Ms. Pelosi has reached with members of her caucus.

She agreed to limit herself to four years as speaker.

Target: The Rebel Anti-Pelosi Faction

In her most consequential compromise that could secure her the speakership, Ms. Pelosi agreed to relinquish the gavel after four years, a deal devised to appease dissidents who have resolutely maintained the party needs new leadership. She had previously argued that imposing term limits on herself would weaken her hand. But in agreeing to do so, she will pick up seven votes, including Representatives Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, Bill Foster of Illinois, Linda Sánchez of California, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Tim Ryan of Ohio, Filemon Vela of Texas and Representative-elect Gil Cisneros of California. More are likely to follow.
