For the past several years, the Heisman Trophy race has not been particularly close in its final week. Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield was considered a certain winner last year, much as Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson was the year before.

This year is different. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, a sophomore and the front-runner for much of the season, has slipped to second place behind Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray, a redshirt junior, if the Bovada betting odds are to be believed.

Two factors make this such a confounding guessing game.

One is that these two generally similar players have some statistics that are strikingly disparate. Oklahoma’s offense — the same Air Raid variant that saw Mayfield win last year under Coach Lincoln Riley — had Murray throwing early and often, while the Alabama offense still relied heavily on the run, as is the tradition for Nick Saban-coached teams. (The dominant Crimson Tide also sat Tagovailoa during many fourth quarters.)

As a result, Murray threw for 700 more yards than Tagovailoa, although he also did it on 46 more attempts. Indeed, Murray averaged just 0.5 yards more per attempt than Tagovailoa, and their yards-per-attempt figures topped the Football Bowl Subdivision.
