On Friday, the person was revealed to be a 42-year-old woman named Bara Halldorsdottir in a web article for the newspaper Stundin whose headline read, “I am a disabled, queer woman, and I was appalled.”

The recording went viral after it was posted online last week, spurring nationwide outrage in a country that has a female prime minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, and that prides itself on its gender equality record after topping the World Economic Forum’s gender gap index for several years. This year, a law was passed that requires companies and government agencies to prove they are paying men and women equally.

Some of the politicians who were recorded have apologized.

Mr. Sveinsson, the former foreign minister, who has a reputation for being a champion of women’s rights, is heard on the recording mocking a female lawmaker for coming forward as part of the “Me Too” movement and laughing at domestic violence accusations made against a former member of Parliament.

Some in the group expressed a desire to sleep with particular female colleagues. One person warned that one such woman could not be trusted because she “plays on men like women know best.” The political career of another woman is questioned because she is “not as hot this year” and her beauty is “fading fast.”

Ms. Arnadottir, the only female politician at the table, is heard at one point responding, “Can I ask you to imagine if this was a male politician you are speaking of?” On the recording, the men erupt in laughter.
