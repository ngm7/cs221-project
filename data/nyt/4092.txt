With his oven-baked black olives, the chef and restaurateur Scott Conant has picked up a Mediterranean tradition in his new line of Sprezza products, made in Italy. His meaty olives are excellent to serve with drinks or to use in salads and other dishes, pitted or not. The chefâ€™s well-seasoned pomodoro sauce for pasta and a rich bruschetta spread, dense with sweet red peppers, are some of the other items in the line.

Sprezza oven-baked olives, $15 for 12.8 ounces; pomodoro sauce, $10 for 13.4 ounces; bruschetta spread, $15 for 9.9 ounces, sognotoscano.com/sprezza.
