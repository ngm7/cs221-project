The Baltimore Ravens had a plan. They would disguise defensive coverages to slow down Patrick Mahomes, and they would grind things out with the running game on offense. The goal was to slow things down, and to keep the ball out of Mahomes’s hands.

The plan very nearly worked.

But Mahomes, in a season that could easily garner him the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award, showed he can survive a battle in the trenches and the Chiefs survived at home, beating the Ravens, 27-24, in overtime.

That the game was so close proved that Baltimore’s throwback style is something to be reckoned with. The Ravens, with a rushing attack led by quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Gus Edwards, gained 198 yards on the ground, just barely missing a fourth consecutive game of 200 or more. Their defense had three sacks, an interception, and hit Mahomes 15 times. And there was a stretch in the third quarter when the Chiefs offense simply disappeared thanks to two long drives by Baltimore and an interception by Chuck Clark.

“We’re a strong team, we can fight with anybody,” Jackson said at his postgame news conference, pointing out that no one had expected them to win against the top team in the A.F.C.
