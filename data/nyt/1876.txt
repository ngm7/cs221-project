It was a trip gone awry that brought Tony Shalhoub his first Tony Award last season, for best performance by a leading actor in a musical. In “The Band’s Visit,” Mr. Shalhoub played the leader of an Arab military band that inadvertently ends up stranded in a small, isolated Israeli town and not the more cultured city it was supposed to travel to for a concert performance. (The fact that one was named Petah Tikva and the other Bet Hatikva — “with a B" — might explain the confusion.)

More recently, Mr. Shalhoub, a three-time Emmy winner for USA Network’s detective procedural series “Monk” (2002-2009), and a nominee this year for his work on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” was in Paris, where some of the scenes for Season 2 of that Amazon series were filmed. (That second season just began streaming.)

When he travels — whether for work or on vacation with his wife, the actress Brooke Adams, — Mr. Shalhoub say he wants to immerse himself in the experience, whether it is exploring art in Venice, ruins in Lebanon or glaciers in Iceland. Which isn’t to say that he isn’t content to just unwind. “I’m always happy if there’s a gorgeous beach involved,” he says. “ I have to say, the most extraordinary ones were in Tahiti. The color of the water, the feel of the water, the temperature of the water — it was so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.”

In a recent email exchange and a follow-up conversation, Mr. Shalhoub revealed some of his most memorable trips, his soft spot for Texas-style ribs, and why he’s over hotels.
