LAS VEGAS — The Mets may have faded from relevance after a hot start last season, but the arrival of the off-season has placed them in the middle of the major-league rumor mill — especially at the annual Winter Meetings this week.

Some rumblings are true, like the Mets’ interest in trading for the Miami Marlins’ All-Star catcher, J.T. Realmuto. Some ideas are simply that, like discussions with the Yankees about the Mets’ star pitcher Noah Syndergaard as part of a three-way trade — which caused a major stir when it circulated around social media on Monday night.

This is all a result of the hyperactive nature of the Mets’ new general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen. Leading into his first Winter Meetings as a G.M. after a career as a player agent, Van Wagenen said Omar Minaya, a special assistant with the Mets and a former general manager, gave him some advice.

“He told me to pace myself,” Van Wagenen said Monday evening. “I didn’t listen to him. I don’t sleep very much and I probably talk to too many people too often. But that’s part of my personality. That’s the fun part.”
