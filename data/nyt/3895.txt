David Shepherd, who played a central role in the development of modern improvisational theater as a founder of the short-lived Compass Players in Chicago, but who declined to join its far more famous and influential successor, the Second City, died on Monday at a rehabilitation facility in Holyoke, Mass. He was 94.

His wife, Nancy Fletcher, confirmed the death.

Mr. Shepherd and Paul Sills started Compass in 1955 in the rear of a bar near the University of Chicago campus. In a departure from conventional theater, there were no scripts: Performers like Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Barbara Harris and Shelley Berman invented scenes and characters on the spot based on audience suggestions, theatrical games and short written scenarios inspired by the European tradition of commedia dell’arte.

“David had a real sense of American culture, where it had gotten stale and how it needed to be opened up,” Janet Coleman, the author of “The Compass” (1990), a history of the group, said in a telephone interview.

Mr. Shepherd — tall, charming and serious — served Compass as producer, actor and occasional director. He also wrote some of the scenarios, which he viewed as critical commentary on political and social issues of the day and central to the shows — even if they were not necessarily comedic, like one that Ms. May conceived about date rape.
