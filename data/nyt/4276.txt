“Welcome to Marwen” is about a grown man who plays with toys. That’s what it looks like Mark Hogancamp is doing, anyway. His house in Kingston, N.Y., is full of dolls, action figures and accessories arranged into a make-believe Belgian village he has named Marwen. In Mark’s fantasy world — which frequently comes to jarring digital life onscreen — his G.I. Joe-like alter ego, a hard-boiled, hard-plastic American soldier known as Hogie, does battle with Nazis, aided by a revolving cast of women with Barbie-doll physiques.

Or maybe Jessica Rabbit is a better reference, since this is a movie by Robert Zemeckis, who puts some of his longstanding preoccupations on vivid, sometimes baffling display. Mark, suffering from a brain injury in the aftermath of a vicious assault, is at once a charming eccentric, a tormented soul and a brilliantly inventive artist. Marwen is his escape, his therapy and his complex multimedia masterwork. Mark’s bigger-than-life photographs of Hogie’s adventures are exhibited in New York galleries. His sophistication is inseparable from his sincerity, something that might be said of Zemeckis, too.

It might be a stretch to say that Mark, played by Steve Carell, is the director’s surrogate. There is a real Mark Hogancamp, whose life and work are the subject of a lovely 2010 documentary by Jeff Malmberg. (It’s called “Marwencol.” To explain the difference between the titles would be a minor spoiler.)
