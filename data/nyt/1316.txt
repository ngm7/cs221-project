It was easy to choose a Top 10 for 2018, but a Top 20 would have been easier yet: There’s been an abundance.

Pam Tanowitz, ‘Four Quartets’

At its world premiere at Bard SummerScape in July, Pam Tanowitz’s “Four Quartets” proved the most sublime new work of dance theater this year. Since it’s concerned with the sublime — it incorporates T.S. Eliot’s celebrated poems — that’s only fitting. Remarkably, Ms. Tanowitz doesn’t illustrate the poems: She lets their words, spoken with a wide range of expression by Kathleen Chalfant, sound like emanations from the complex stage world created here.

Caleb Teicher, ‘More Forever’

Another choreographer who reached a new peak this year was the tap artist Caleb Teicher. He, the pianist-composer Conrad Tao and six dancers gave a preview performance of “More Forever” as part of the Guggenheim Museum’s Works & Process series in October. (The finished product will be performed at the museum on Jan. 6 and 7.) “More Forever” constantly extended the sonic aspects of dance. The use of release and silence at the end of phrases was astounding; the interplay between quiet and loud, between percussive and stroked footwork, and the immense range of dynamics and meters within a phrase.

New York City Ballet Gala

New York City Ballet’s Sept. 27 gala earned not one entry in the annals but two. The solos danced by Taylor Stanley in Kyle Abraham’s “The Runaway” exemplified many American diversities, not least stylistic ones. And earlier in the evening, Teresa Reichlen’s moving “We, the dancers” speech, on behalf of City Ballet’s performers — who flanked her onstage — established fresh moral criteria for the company: “We will not put art before common decency or allow talent to sway our moral compass.” Amid a troubled year offstage for City Ballet, her words have only grown in significance.
