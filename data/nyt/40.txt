On the morning of July 16, 1964, James Powell, a 15-year-old black student, was shot and killed by an off-duty white police officer on East 76th Street in Manhattan, setting off days of protests and riots.

On Sunday afternoon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, about half a mile from where the shooting took place, a member of the Young People’s Chorus of New York City read from Langston Hughes’s poem “Death in Yorkville,” inspired by Powell’s death: “How many bullets does it take to kill a 15-year-old kid?”

You couldn’t help but walk the blocks to 76th Street in your mind as the chorus member spoke the lines.

The performance was part of the soprano Julia Bullock’s residency at the Met this season: a series of programs including settings of the words of black artists from the South and fresh versions of traditional slave songs; a reflection on the legacy of Josephine Baker; “El Niño,” John Adams’s exploration of the Nativity story; and Hans Werner Henze’s oratorio about a runaway slave.
