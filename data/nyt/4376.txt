House lawmakers concerned about the possibility of self-dealing and other hidden conflicts of interest in Puerto Rico’s $123 billion bankruptcy introduced a measure on Wednesday intended to strengthen reporting requirements, after one of the case’s most influential consultants was shown to have an undisclosed stake in Puerto Rico’s debt.

Representatives put the bipartisan measure forward after The New York Times reported that the consultant, McKinsey & Company, had bought millions of dollars’ worth of Puerto Rican bonds at a deep discount and had not disclosed that investment. That puts the consulting firm, which is advising a federal oversight board as it leads the island through fiscal reforms and a debt restructuring, in a position to profit from the plans that it is helping to design.

“The people of Puerto Rico can’t have faith that this oversight board is putting their interests first if consultants helping implement the restructuring could profit from how much debt service is available under the very fiscal plans they design,” said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, the New York Democrat who is the lead sponsor of the bill.

Other sponsors include Representative Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee; Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who is expected to become chairman next year; and Jenniffer González-Colón, the Republican who represents Puerto Rico as a nonvoting member. The House Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction over United States territories and drafted the bankruptcy-like law that governs Puerto Rico’s restructuring proceedings, but it left out the disclosure provisions customarily found in bankruptcy statutes.
