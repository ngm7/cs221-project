Re “Flynn Was Looking for Leniency; Judge Gave Him a Stern Rebuke” (front page, Dec. 19):

Judge Emmet Sullivan injected a dose of sanity into the Michael Flynn matter with an appropriately sharp rebuke of this criminal. Up till then the civics message seemed to be: the greater your crime, the less your time ... as long as you cooperate with prosecutors. What, like cooperation is some kind of selfless gesture when you’re caught raiding the cookie jar?

The judge even brought up the “T” word when he asked prosecutors if Mr. Flynn had possibly committed treason. Geez, I hope not, insofar as the reverse logic of the prosecutors would have probably awarded this miscreant with a Trump penthouse for his generous cooperation.

Confessing to crimes you’ve already been indicted for should never constitute a “get out of jail free” card. Just as the failure of the Obama Justice Department to punish the worst offenders in the 2008 financial crisis has emboldened this shameless crowd to pursue their old tricks yet again, the soft-on-slime prosecution of the most corrupt among us will not deter bad behavior.

Judge Emmet Sullivan is a straight shooter with a deep moral core. He spoke truth to Michael Flynn, and in doing so he reminded us what justice is all about. Years ago as a young attorney, I spent many hours in Judge Sullivan’s courtroom at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Probate Division .
