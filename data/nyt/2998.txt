Investors were confronted on Friday with more evidence that the trade war between the United States and China is weighing on economic growth, and stocks fell to their deepest decline of the week.

The S&P 500-stock index fell 1.9 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2 percent.

All three of these indexes are more than 10 percent below their recent peaks. Such declines are typically described as “corrections,” a designation that describes a market that’s seriously slumping but not yet in bear-market territory of losses of more than 20 percent.

Weak data on industrial output and retail sales in China kicked off the global market downturn Friday. The numbers further inflamed worries among investors that the trade war between the United States and China is beginning to slow global economic growth. China, the world’s second-largest economy, had reported a slowdown in trade and economic growth in recent weeks. But the numbers on retail sales and industrial output suggested that the slowdown deepened in November.
