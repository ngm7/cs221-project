Faizal Coto fought fires for a living, and rapped and composed lyrics as a hip-hop artist in his spare time. But his life came to a brutal end on the shoulder of the Belt Parkway early Sunday morning, in what police believe was a road rage incident that turned deadly.

Police said on Tuesday that they had tracked a silver Infiniti that sped away from the scene of Mr. Coto’s killing to a motel in New Jersey, where they arrested Joseph C. Desmond, 29, on a parole violation.

Mr. Desmond, who was being questioned by the police about Mr. Coto’s death, had been released from prison in April after serving four years in New York for drug possession and an unrelated assault, prison records show.

The killer left Mr. Coto, 33, near the road, bludgeoned and bleeding from the head, the police said. By the time emergency services found him, it was too late. Mr. Coto was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital shortly afterward.
