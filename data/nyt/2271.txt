A luxury cruise usually comes with luxury pricing, but there are ways to save money on your next onboard getaway, said Judy Perl, a cruise specialist and the founder of Judy Perl Worldwide Travel. “You can get a lot more for your money if you know what to look for when picking an itinerary,” she said.

Here, she offers some tips to get the most bang for your buck the next time you book a cruise:

Look for “positioning cruises”

In the cruise industry, “positioning cruises” (sometimes referred to as “repositioning cruises,”) are ones where a ship relocates from one region to the next. According to Ms. Perl, these itineraries are generally lower-priced because they’re often one-way tickets from one location to another, and they often occur during the off-season or shoulder seasons.

Examples of these cruises include a trans-Atlantic crossing from Miami to Lisbon in time for the Mediterranean sailing season, a coastal cruise from Los Angeles to Vancouver in time for Alaska’s season and one from New York to St. Thomas in time for Caribbean season.
