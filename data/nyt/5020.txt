The young man was found face up on a blanket in a marshy park in Far Rockaway, Queens, bloodied from gunshot wounds to the head. He was wearing only blue underwear and white socks, the police said.

The 23-year-old man, identified as Ian Cruz, might have been a target of MS-13, the transnational gang that President Trump has used as a rallying cry against illegal immigration, the authorities said on Sunday.

The police have arrested five people, including a 14-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, in connection with the Dec. 16 murder, according to a complaint filed in Criminal Court in Queens.

One of the suspects, Elmer Guttierez, 18, was arrested on weapon charges, while four others, Yonathan Sanchez, 22, Carlos Guerra, 18, and the two teenagers, whose names were not released, were accused of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.
