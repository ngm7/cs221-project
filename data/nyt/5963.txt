Starting Jan. 1, pharmacies in all five boroughs will not be allowed to sell tobacco products. That includes big-box stores and supermarkets that have pharmacies.

“People trust pharmacies to help them stay well,” the deputy mayor for health and human services, Herminia Palacio, said in a statement last week. “They should be helping smokers quit, not the opposite.”

The change is a result of a package of bills that Mayor Bill de Blasio signed in 2017 after anti-tobacco activists criticized the mayor for not aggressively combating smoking. Under the same laws, the city banned the sale of e-cigarettes in pharmacies in August .

About 500 pharmacies in the city that still sell tobacco products will be affected, the statement said.

Birth certificates

Beginning in 2019, New York City will allow people who do not identify as male or female to change the gender markers on their birth certificates to a nonbinary option.

In addition to the standard gender markers of “M” and “F,” birth certificates will also add “X,” a gender-neutral marker.

The “X,” meant to stand for a gender identity not exclusively male or female, will set the city’s documents apart from those issued in the rest of the state, which does not offer nonbinary options.
