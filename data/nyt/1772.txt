Every summer during my childhood, my family would take a road trip from Southern California to visit my grandparents in rural Texas. They had a modest house in the country. I remember spending our days sitting on the front porch, with the sun-bleached metal rocking chairs, the melting Popsicles, my grandmother braiding our hair.

The porch was simple. Concrete. Two steps. Covered. It was where I learned about black life in the South â€” its folklore, traditions and spiritual foundations. It was where I learned about myself.

This week, my colleague Audra D.S. Burch wrote about the porch and its significance in the African-American imagination.

Audra went to Detroit with Germane Barnes, an African-American architecture professor at the University of Miami whose current research explores the historical role that the front porch has played in shaping black identity, and interviewed black homeowners about their porches.
