NASHVILLE — Jerry Chesnut, a blue-collar songwriter who wrote hits for Elvis Presley, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson and more than 100 other popular artists, including another Elvis, Costello, died on Saturday at his home in Brentwood, Tenn. He was 87.

His death was confirmed by Mark Ford, executive director of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, which inducted Mr. Chesnut in 1996. Mr. Ford said Mr. Chesnut had experienced respiratory problems since October.

Mr. Chesnut had a gift for illuminating the struggles of working people, like the beleaguered factory hand in “Oney,” a song, drawn from his experience with a tyrannical employer, that became a Top 10 country hit for Johnny Cash in 1972.

“Looking at the World Through a Windshield,” a two-stepping country hit for the singer Del Reeves in 1968, portrays a solitary trucker speeding through the night, longing for home. Written with Mike Hoyer, the song was later recorded by the country-rock bands Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen and Son Volt.
