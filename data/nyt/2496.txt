Chinese artworks and artifacts that a 19th-century Chinese scholar acquired while working for emperors’ families will be given to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the museum announced Thursday.

The donor, the historian, filmmaker and collector Wan-go H.C. Weng, age 100, is a great-great-grandson of the original owner, Weng Tonghe. Starting around 1865, Weng Tonghe spent decades in imperial palaces, tutoring Qing dynasty teenagers in line for the throne while stretching his government salary to buy art.

The Weng family’s museum donation, with about 200 pieces made as early as the seventh century, includes landscape paintings, portraits, pages of calligraphy, embroidery and playing cards. (A spokeswoman said that as a rule the MFA does not reveal the values of works of art, but added that the collection is “one of the most significant gifts in the museum’s history.”)

Nancy Berliner, the museum’s senior curator of Chinese art, said that Weng Tonghe’s diary survives. He recorded his frequent trips to art galleries, and wrote of his decision to build his collection rather than buy property for his family.
