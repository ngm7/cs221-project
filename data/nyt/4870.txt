To the Editor:

Re “Mattis Resigns After Trump’s Syria Pullout” (front page, Dec. 21):

If there is any silver lining to the dark cloud of Jim Mattis’s resignation as defense secretary, it is perhaps that now, finally, my fellow Republicans will wake up.

For different, but equally compelling reasons, three true military heroes, Gens. H.R. McMaster, John Kelly and Jim Mattis — men of unmatched courage and patriotism who served in Donald Trump’s administration and have a firsthand understanding of who the commander in chief is, what his capabilities are and where he wants to take our country — have all decided that Mr. Trump is not worthy of their continued service.

That should worry every American. One wonders and shudders to think about what else has to happen for Republicans to realize that for the good of the country, we have to rally around someone else in 2020.
