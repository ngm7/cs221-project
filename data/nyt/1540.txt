Neither of the episodes — the attack on Ottinger or the incident with the man at a Lake Erie resort — resulted in criminal charges against Hunt, or discipline from the league. But the narrow scope of the investigators’ recent questioning — at a time when the N.F.L. knew about the hotel attack but, it says, had not seen the video — points to the fits and starts of an N.F.L. inquiry that security experts who have worked with league say was less than rigorous and at times puzzling for a lack of a thoroughness.

Four years after another damning surveillance video, of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching out his fiancée in a hotel elevator, blindsided the N.F.L., the Hunt incident also reveals how the league continues to struggle with challenges similar to those that plagued the Rice investigation. The former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller, whom the N.F.L. tapped to investigate its handling of the Rice matter, wrote in his report on that case that “the NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information” about the episode.

The N.F.L. said its investigators had not spoken to Hunt about the hotel assault in February when they interviewed him this fall — in meetings than can sometimes last hours — because it was still gathering evidence.

But an examination of the investigation shows that the N.F.L. relied on the word of the Chiefs, who had a vested interest in keeping a star on the field, and did not press to independently verify the account of the incident that Hunt gave to them. Those actions have left the N.F.L. trying to explain another high-profile stumble in its stated effort to take seriously accusations that its players have behaved violently, especially in cases involving women.
