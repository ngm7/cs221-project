COLOMBO, Sri Lanka â€” A Sri Lankan court issued an order on Monday temporarily preventing the disputed prime minister from holding office, the latest twist in a political crisis that has paralyzed the island nation.

The Court of Appeal ordered Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cabinet to appear on Dec. 12 and to explain on what authority they hold office after Parliament voted against them twice last month. The order prohibits them from conducting government business in the meantime.

Mr. Rajapaksa said in a statement that he did not agree with the ruling and would appeal the decision at the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning.

Sri Lanka has been thrown into political disarray since late October, when President Maithripala Sirisena ousted his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with Mr. Rajapaksa, a decision that was deemed unconstitutional. Mr. Wickremesinghe and Mr. Rajapaksa both claim to be the legitimate holder of the office.
