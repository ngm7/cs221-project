• The Brexit vote looms.

Protesters from Britain’s left and right took to the streets over the weekend, offering starkly different visions of the country’s future. Above, pro-Brexit demonstrators.

Parliament is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the government’s plans to leave the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May and her team have been scrambling to shore up support for her compromise deal, which they’re painting as the best possible alternative to a potentially disastrous “no deal” exit.

But more than 100 lawmakers from her Conservative Party have said they will vote against the deal, a potential threat to Mrs. May’s leadership. Much of the resistance to Mrs. May’s deal is due, in part, to her own choices. “Early on, she expended vast reserves of energy reassuring the hard-line faction of her party that she was on their side,” writes our London-based chief diplomatic correspondent, Ellen Barry. Two and a half years later, she revealed a plan that should have appealed to moderates — but “had few reserves of trust or loyalty to draw upon.”

Our reporter traveled to Sunderland, a deprived northern city that voted 61 percent to 39 percent to leave the E.U. He found many voters frustrated that Mrs. May’s deal would not deliver the windfall they were promised during the campaign.
