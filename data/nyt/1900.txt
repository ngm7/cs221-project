A huge fraud at a Malaysian investment fund has cast a harsh light on Goldman Sachs. But how much could the scandal cost the firm?

Wall Street has been trying to estimate the amount of legal penalties and settlements Goldman may pay after United States prosecutors unveiled a guilty plea by a former senior Goldman Sachs investment banker and charged a second banker.

The affair appears to have taken its toll on Goldman’s stock. Its shares are down 20 percent since the Justice Department’s charges were revealed. By comparison, bank stocks as a whole are down 6 percent, and shares of Morgan Stanley, Goldman’s rival, have fallen nearly 10 percent.
