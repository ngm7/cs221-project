Ms. Nuam San, 20, recalled last month how much her life had changed since she moved to the United States five years ago. At the time, she spoke no English and came from a country where women are expected to stay at home. Now she is a freshman at Agnes Scott, a small, private women’s liberal arts college outside Atlanta. The college, founded in 1889, appealed to her, she said, because it “would help me become more powerful as a woman, a lot more than just being a house-worker.”

Along the way, she and her family received help from the International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
