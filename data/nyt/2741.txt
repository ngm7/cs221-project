Stocks briefly clawed back into positive territory for the year on Wednesday, as Beijing and Washington both hinted that they could make concessions to strike a deal on trade.

The S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 stock indexes all rose after President Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he would intervene in the Department of Justice case against a prominent Chinese telecommunications executive, if it would help secure a deal over trade.

Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported that China was drafting a policy to replace its Made in China 2025 program to offer foreign companies greater access to the Chinese market.
