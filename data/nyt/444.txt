This is a tale of patriarchal double standards and sexual disgrace — but the humiliation turned out to be his, not hers.

In “Bringing Down the Colonel,” the journalist Patricia Miller has unearthed the case of Madeline Pollard, who brought a lawsuit against Col. W.C.P. Breckinridge, a five-term House representative from Kentucky, for breach of promise to marry. Miller began working on her book more than a decade ago, long before the revelations and reckonings of #MeToo, but what she found is a story from the 19th century that rumbles and resonates in our own.

When Pollard filed her suit in 1893, the United States was reeling from a financial crisis that would signal the end of the Gilded Age and the beginning of the Progressive Era. The scandal offered a “welcome diversion” when the country was hankering for one. A demoralized public wanted to hear about something other than cascading bankruptcies and grinding unemployment.

The scandal amounted to something more than a distraction. It both embodied and repudiated a set of sexual attitudes that was starting, however slowly, to change. Breach of promise lawsuits weren’t uncommon at the time; Miller describes them as a “Victorian-era legal convention” that recognized marriage as “a woman’s primary vocation.” A woman could recover damages for a broken engagement that left her with “neither her virginity nor a wedding band to show for it.”
