Today, the veterans of that administration have long since moved on to other ventures or retirement. Some have written books. Others have taught college classes. So the occasion of Mr. Bush’s death has become the occasion to bring the team back together in what may be its last such gathering.

Around town could be seen plenty of familiar faces: James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and longtime friend of the president who was in the room with him, rubbing his feet, when he died; Dick Cheney, who served as defense secretary in the first Bush administration and vice president in the second; Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first and secretary of state in the second.

Waiting outside the Capitol on Monday when the former president’s coffin, draped with a flag, arrived were John H. Sununu, his White House chief of staff; Bill Barr, his attorney general; Elizabeth Dole, his secretary of labor. Bob Dole, 95, her husband and former Senate majority leader, went to the rotunda on Tuesday and was helped out of a wheelchair to his feet so he could salute the man who defeated him for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988.

And of course there were the Bushes themselves, a large and boisterous clan from Maine, Texas and everywhere in between. George Bush and his wife of 73 years, Barbara, who died in April, had six children, 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, and then there were the spouses and cousins and step-grandchildren and others.
