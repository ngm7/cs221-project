Winds blowing between 10 and 15 miles per hour over InSight’s solar panels caused the spacecraft to vibrate, and short-period seismometers recorded the vibrations.

“You can think of it rather in the same way as the human ear, how we in fact listen,” said Thomas Pike, a scientist at Imperial College London who is leading research with the instruments. “The solar panels are like the ear drum. The spacecraft structure is like the inner ear.”

The seismometers act as the cochlea, the parts of your ears that convert the vibrations into nerve signals. They are able to record vibrations up to a frequency of 50 Hertz — audible to human ears as a low rumble.

NASA also produced a version of the recording that lifted the sounds by two octaves.
