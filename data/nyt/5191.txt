An Early Goodbye to My Family

She said she understood why we couldn’t spend Christmas together. I sent her so many “I miss you” texts. “Your parents will come around someday,” she replied. She spent the day alone in our apartment, not texting me much so I wouldn’t sense her sadness. I sensed it anyway. So I said an early goodbye to my family in Kentucky and drove seven and a half hours back to Iowa, arriving in time to sleep next to her under our string lights. That is when I learned what really matters on a day like Christmas: being around the person you love most. — Amanda Hancock
