Turkey has postponed a military offensive in northeastern Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, citing conversations with President Trump and other American officials, but he added that it would eventually follow through on plans for an assault on Kurdish and Islamic State forces there.

Turkish officials said publicly last week that the country was a few days away from beginning an invasion of Syria to attack the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the United States’ closest ally in the complex and devastating Syrian civil war.

That raised the prospect of an accidental clash between American forces working with the Kurdish-led group and Turkey, a fellow NATO member. But this week, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of United States forces in Syria.

That delighted Turkey and the primary supporters of the Syrian government — Russia and Iran — while enraging Kurds and many American officials who saw it as abandoning a vulnerable ally. Israeli officials also said Friday that they felt abandoned by the decision, which they said strengthens Iran’s hold on Syria and creates a strategic threat to Israel.
