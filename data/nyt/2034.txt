Wall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors’ unease about the global economy and corporate profits.

After slipping by nearly 2 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red.

Technology stocks led the rebound on Wall Street, and trading in Apple illustrated the upswing. Apple shares fell as much as 2 percent early Monday, after a Chinese court said the company had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and must stop selling seven of its most popular iPhones in the country. But the shares recovered, up 0.7 percent at the close, after Apple said that it was still selling all iPhone models in China and that it had filed a request for “reconsideration” with the court.
