To the Editor:

Re “Trump Parkland Inquiry Attacks Protections for Minority Students” (front page, Dec. 18):

Yes, we have seen mass casualty shootings, but over all, violence in schools is down, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey. It reports that the percentage of students threatened or injured with a weapon at school went from 7.8 percent in 2007 to 6 percent in 2017 . This is good, and the Trump administration should wonder why.

One factor is a shift away from zero-tolerance disciplinary practices toward restorative-justice interventions. These practices focus on preventing and healing harm. In contrast, suspensions often push students to drop out and do little to address causes of violence.

The Obama administration recommended such practices because they work. They build community and trust, essential to learning. They help interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. This is especially important for our country’s black and brown children.

And restorative practice works for white children, too. If only our current president truly cared about any of them.
