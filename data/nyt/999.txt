In North Carolina, a House race is being investigated for potential voter fraud. Today, we called Alan Blinder, a Times national correspondent covering the story, while he was out interviewing voters in Elizabethtown, N.C.

Lisa: This has been a complicated story. What’s the latest?

Alan: The latest twist is that Republicans seem to be modifying their position a little bit. We’ve been hearing from Republicans for some time that they thought the state needed to certify the election immediately. And then, a little bit ago, Dallas Woodhouse told me the party would be open to a new election if there was a showing of fraud.

He told me he’d been watching TV and had thrown up watching one of the reports.

He threw up? Like, physically?

Yes, he physically threw up. He said he was watching TV on Wednesday night and became physically ill. So the Republicans are all standing by Mark Harris at this point, but they’re opening the door to the idea that there may have been some real trouble in the Ninth District.

That seems like a big development.

It shows the party is getting a sense of trouble here, that this is not going away. This is a state where Republicans have spent a lot of time and energy talking about how to erase voter fraud and election fraud, and now, in one of the highest-profile races in the year in North Carolina, a Republican is accused of being a beneficiary of fraud.

What are you hearing when you knock on doors?

To be honest with you, not a lot of doors open with a story like this. We’ve had some successes with finding people who will detail and talk about their experiences, but a lot of times people don’t want to talk. But we have heard some firsthand accounts of activities that really raise questions about what happened here.
