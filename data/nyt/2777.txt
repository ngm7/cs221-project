The academic quarter at the University of California, Irvine lasts 10 weeks.

But one group of freshmen was given a head start this year. As part of the campus Student Success Initiative, nearly 100 first-generation students were welcomed into dorms this summer, months before the fall quarter began. The program is one of several in the University of California system that aim to give them access to the same kind of help many students get from parents with more resources.

“One guy from my math class talked about doing the work with his dad and I just laughed,” said Ritika Saini, a freshman from Bakersfield. “I haven’t gotten help from my parents on school work since I was in elementary school.”

Last week, we checked in with 10 of those students, who are now preparing for their first set of finals. While they are facing some challenges, none of the students I talked to fear dropping out, as many college freshman do. Here are a few things they told me about their experiences as first-generation students so far:

• They are seeking the help they need: Several spoke of taking advantage of free tutoring services and said they made regular appointments for counseling on campus. (“I know if I can talk, it’ll be easier to take care of myself,” said Fernando Ibarra, who grew up in the Central Valley.)
