1. President Trump ordered a rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. ground troops from Syria, declaring the four-year American-led war against the Islamic State largely won, officials said. “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” the president said in a Twitter post.

He offered no details on his plans for the military mission in Syria, and there was no official announcement of the strategy from the White House.

Pentagon officials seeking to talk the president out of the decision argued that such a move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria — and who could be vulnerable to an attack by Turkey. Above, in the Syrian town of Derik.
