There have been other recent instances of artistic flare-ups on campuses. Last year, Brandeis University canceled a Michael Weller play about Lenny Bruce after students and faculty protested its depictions of minorities. Around the same time, the University of Connecticut’s student union axed an appearance by the comedian Owen Benjamin, who had made comments about transgender children and hormone replacement. And in October, Kent State University canceled a production of “West Side Story,” after students were upset by the lead roles not going to people of color.

Amid the #MeToo movement, many works of art are being reassessed for how they discuss power dynamics. Last week, WDOK, a radio station in Cleveland, said it would stop playing the Christmas song “Baby It’s Cold Outside,” written in the 1940s by Frank Loesser. The song has come under fire for lyrics indicating the male singer has pressured a woman into spending the night with him and plied her with alcohol.

Some of Princeton’s a cappella groups, like the Tigerlilies, have audience-participation songs. The objections to the Tigertones were brought to the forefront in a column written by a sophomore, Noa Wollstein, earlier last week, in The Daily Princetonian. Titled “Dear Tigertones, please stop singing ‘Kiss the Girl,’” Wollstein said that the song was “more misogynistic and dismissive of consent than cute” and that “by performing the song multiple times each semester, the Tigertones elevate it to an offensive and violating ritual.”

In “The Little Mermaid,” Sebastian, the crab who often serves as a guardian for the mermaid Ariel, sings the number with the help of other creatures. He exhorts Prince Eric to kiss Ariel, who cannot speak because she has given up her voice to become human so she can be with Eric. She appears to want the kiss. By the end, Ariel and Eric lean in, but the boat capsizes before the meeting of lips can occur.
