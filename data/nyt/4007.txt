Good morning. I teamed up this week with the photographer Daniel Krieger to document the last days of the Red Cat, Jimmy Bradley’s terrific restaurant in the Chelsea district of Manhattan, which is closing after dinner service on Dec. 23, after 19 years.

And, of course, I’m using the occasion to bring forth a couple of great old Red Cat recipes The Times has picked up over the years, including one for Bradley’s tempura-fried green beans with spicy-sweet mustard sauce and another for his hepcat stoner-food melty-cheese salad extravaganza, essentially fondue topped with a bacon-flecked potato salad and topped again with endive and arugula. Make that salad for dinner tonight, and you’ll be able to choose horses correctly at the track for at least the next week. (Soundtrack: The Hold Steady, “Chips Ahoy.”)

But perhaps you were looking for Christmas dishes? Priya Krishna brought us a lovely curried goat from Jamaica via Central Islip on Long Island, where Hazel Craig has for decades celebrated the holiday island-style. To go with it, try her callalloo and a sweet potato pudding for dessert.

More ambitiously, we have a spectacular new recipe for a yule log (above) from the incomparable Yotam Ottolenghi. (If that’s too much for you, try his new recipe for an upside-down date cake with cognac marscapone instead.)
