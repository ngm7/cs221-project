Ms. Guerard, who runs Tara Guérard Soirée, recently started incorporating beauty bars in the ladies’ bathrooms at the receptions of weddings she organizes. Depending on the size of the event, she’ll have two to three hair and makeup artists available, complete with lipsticks, curling irons, hair spray and more to fix any beauty malfunctions. She adds flowers and a “Glam Bar” sign.

She collaborates with a local freelance makeup artist and hair stylist, Deidre Outlaw, who actually came up with the idea. Ms. Outlaw frequently heard from brides that they wanted a zhuzh before the reception after their inevitable tears during the ceremony. “I thought this could be a great service to add for the guests of weddings, too,” Ms. Outlaw said.

The pair noted that the service is particularly successful in hot summer months or generally warm weather. This past June, Ms. Outlaw hosted a glam bar at a wedding in Adairsville, Ga., where the space exuded charm but lacked air-conditioning “To say it was a total hit is an understatement,” Ms. Outlaw said of the steady flow of guests looking for touch-ups. “We did quick five-minute touch-ups to get their frizzy hair off their necks, T-zones de-shined, and a fresh lip.”

Brittany Lo, the founder of Beautini, a hair and makeup business in New York City, also offers beauty amenities to guests at weddings and other social events. She will set up in the lounge area of large restrooms at luxury hotels, or private rooms near the reception area if the restroom is small, or stake out a spot next to the photo booth. Even male guests may receive a puff of powder.

“People run to the bathroom every 10 dances or so to make sure that their makeup is in place and they don’t look like a hot mess,” Ms. Lo said. “This provides a next-level service for them: Someone else quickly does it, and then the guest runs back out to the dance floor.”
