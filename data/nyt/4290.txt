Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

I recently wrote about how California can feel like home to almost anyone. But even if it feels like home, it’s increasingly tough to afford living in the state.

Scott Wiener, a state senator from San Francisco, says he’s trying to fix that. He’s the legislator behind a divisive housing bill, S.B. 827, which died last year. The idea? Require cities to allow the construction of eight-story apartment buildings near transit stops, even if local governments object.

This year, he resurrected the proposal, now called S.B. 50, and with some changes. I asked Mr. Wiener about how it addresses some of the concerns with the earlier bill. (The interview has been edited and condensed.)

Jill Cowan: How does the new version address concerns about displacement?

Scott Wiener: I took to heart the criticisms that the geography of S.B. 827 disproportionately affected lower income communities. We worked intensely with housing equity advocates in L.A. and the Bay Area to address those criticisms. We’re still fleshing out the details.
