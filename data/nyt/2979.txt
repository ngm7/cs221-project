And there, N, lies the problem.

Cory Windelspecht, 38, said that seeing the tree covering the N instead of that adjacent A bugged him for years. So he started a campaign to adjust the Christmas decorations.

That rang a bell for quite a few other people and now, after his online petition went viral, the authority says it will allow the public to vote on where the agency hangs its holiday décor.

Mr. Windelspecht lives in TriBeCa, but because of his job in medical sales, he said, he passes through the Holland Tunnel at least three days a week. And every time he sees the placement of the tree, it makes his skin crawl.

“It’s just ugly,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense.”

So this year, he decided to take action, posting photos and videos of the sign on social media. As his posts were viewed and shared, he also decided to launch a petition on Change.org asking for the Christmas tree to be moved over the A.

By Wednesday night, more than 1,500 people had signed it, and many more had commented about it on social media.
