I told him that to produce a credible piece, I would need to identify the women by their full names. I also would need to review every relevant document, fake and real, to ascertain whether they were telling the truth.

He began sending me material: A recent certificate of appreciation for Ms. Morales from the White House Communications Agency in recognition of her “outstanding” service to the president; a housekeeping work schedule that listed her; pay stubs and more. They appeared authentic.

Yet how could I be certain that Ms. Morales was indeed undocumented?

Many undocumented immigrants aim to live under the radar, focused on providing for their families. Unless an undocumented immigrant has encountered law enforcement or immigration authorities, she or he barely leaves a trace anywhere.

I reached out to Kitty Bennett, a veteran Times researcher who is expert at tracing the untraceable, to begin the detective work.

She confirmed that Ms. Morales lived at the address on her pay stub, which carried the legal name of the golf course and the address of the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue. It was identical to the pay stub of Mr. Romero’s other client, Sandra Diaz, who had worked at the golf club between 2010 and 2013.

The absence of any public record corresponding to the number on Ms. Morales’s Social Security card suggested that it was made up. Three initials in a line of code on the back of her permanent resident card did not match those of any government center that issues green cards.

Under Ms. Morales’s name, there was no crime, traffic offense or voter registration in any database.
