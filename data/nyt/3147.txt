Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

BKLYN ARCTIC ADVENTURE at City Point (Dec. 14-16 and 21-23, noon-9 p.m.). Young New Yorkers will be happy to hear that the North Pole has relocated — if only temporarily — to Downtown Brooklyn. There they can feel as if they were visiting Santa Claus in his own digs. Created by the designers at YokeyPokey Virtual Reality Club, Bklyn Arctic Adventure (near City Point’s Albee Square entrance) invites children to put on headsets and embark on a sleigh ride across the skies. It takes them past Mrs. Claus’s bakery to Santa’s secret workshop, where dancing elves are busily building toys. Available this weekend and next — reserving a timed slot is advised — the 10-minute expedition is free. Winter Smorgasbord, a half-hour virtual-reality journey, is not, but it offers games: Merry Snowballs, in which a child can hurl those missiles at angry gingerbread men (perhaps they’d prefer not to be eaten), and Santa Sling, in which the player uses a magic slingshot to aim presents down chimneys. Apparently, all those reindeer deserve a rest.
