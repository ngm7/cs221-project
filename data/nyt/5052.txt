A planning board proposal under review would maintain the restrictions on the small portion of the harbor with piers used by lobster fishermen, buying stations and a bait supplier. But the other three-quarters of the so-called Maritime District, which is lined with modest wooden inns, which were built before the restrictions were in place. The district would be rezoned, making it possible for them to be redeveloped.

Critics say the town should not give up a scarce resource. Only 20 miles of Maine’s 3,500-mile shoreline can still be considered working waterfront, according to the Island Institute, a community development organization. Maine Preservation, a nonprofit group, even put Boothbay Harbor’s working waterfront on this year’s list of the state’s Most Endangered Historic Places, citing the threat posed by the zoning proposal.
