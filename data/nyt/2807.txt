Last year was a big one for the Omer Quartet. The group took second prize in the Trondheim Competition in Norway and first prize in the auditions held by Young Concert Artists, which presented the Omer in its New York debut at Merkin Concert Hall this week. These four musicians, who came together at the Cleveland Institute of Music, certainly rose to the occasion. They opened with a poised, mature and ebullient account of Haydn’s String Quartet in C (Op. 20, No. 2); gave a glowing, vividly dramatic performance of Debussy’s String Quartet in G minor; and brought out the punchy energy of Chris Rogerson’s String Quartet No. 1, written in 2009, when its composer was just 20. To end, the intrepid players (Mason Yu and Erica Tursi, violins; Jinsun Hong, viola; Alex Cox, cello) tore through the contrapuntal tangles of Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge, a fearless rendering of this astonishing piece. You can see them on this 2017 video giving an arresting performance of Bartok’s Third String Quartet, my favorite of that composer’s six quartets. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
