Almost two-thirds of women of childbearing age in the United States use contraceptives, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Almost all American women turn to contraception at some point in their lives. But at any given time, many may not be using it for various reasons: because they are pregnant or trying to be, for example, or are not sexually active.

In interviews, part of a national survey conducted from 2015 to 2017, women were asked about their use of contraceptives in the current month.

There are 72.2 million women aged 15 to 49 in the United States. Over all, 64.9 percent use some form of contraception, the researchers estimated.
