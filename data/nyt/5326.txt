Travel is unpredictable, and sometimes that’s a good thing. You spot a humpback whale during your boat tour, for example. Other times, those unpredictable travel moments are utterly aggravating, like when bad weather cancels your flight or the hotel you’ve booked can’t seem to find your reservation.

Obviously you want to minimize the frustrating experiences as much as you can. This is especially important if it’s your first time traveling outside of the country and you might not know what to expect. From passports to jet lag, here are a few tips for a smooth first trip abroad.

Apply for a passport early

Passports can take up to six weeks to process, and as a first-timer, you’ll have to book an appointment to apply for one in person at a passport acceptance facility, so make sure to apply early. If you need a passport sooner, you can have it expedited in two to three weeks, but it will cost you an extra $60. Before your appointment, make sure you have the required documents ready (proof of citizenship, a valid form of ID, photocopies of both, and form DS11). Make sure to include the application fee in your travel budget too — your first passport will cost you around $150.

Not all facilities will take your passport photo on-site, so you might need to bring one with you. For passport photos, “the post office is a common first option,” said Elise Fitzsimmons, publisher and co-founder of the travel magazine Unearth Women, “but the lines are often long, and you may need to schedule an appointment.” She added, “I live in a rural area and getting passport and visa photos taken at FedEx has been a lifesaver. The turnaround time is about fifteen minutes.” You can also get a quick passport photo at most drugstore photo departments, like CVS or Walgreens.
