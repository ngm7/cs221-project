Ana Helfer replays the day over and over in her mind.

In the winter of 1997, she had just loaded her car with groceries when she discovered that she needed a jump-start. She called everyone she knew, but no one picked up. So she walked back to her Staten Island apartment to see if someone could help.

“No one was around, not one person,” Ms. Helfer, 55, recalled. “But I did see his car in the driveway, so I went and asked him if he could help me out.” The car belonged to her landlord, Brian Helfer.

After helping with her car, he asked Ms. Helfer on a date. They married the next fall. Afterward, she said, he quickly became emotionally and physically abusive.

“I always think, ‘Why?’ Why didn’t I just call one of the tow companies to give me a jump?” Ms. Helfer said recently in her Staten Island home, shaking her head. “Why didn’t I just sit and wait for someone to come. The hell with the groceries. You go with the woulda, coulda, shouldas, and it eats you away. It does nothing, because it doesn’t change anything.”
