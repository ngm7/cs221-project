To the Editor:

Re “This Gender Gap Can’t Be Stressed Enough” (Smarter Living, Business Day, Nov. 26):

This is a rare article that so clearly and thoroughly describes women’s stressors and how those stressors have been disregarded and demeaned over time.

For more than 25 years I have visited homes as a visiting nurse, the last 10 in an independent living community of about 3,000 residents. Repeatedly I have heard the women I visit apologize that their homes could be ... better vacuumed, freshly dusted, dishes completely washed, laundry done and more. And I repeatedly say to them, “Do you know how many men, after 10 years of visits, explain their lack of housekeeping?”

I hold up my hand and make a zero.
