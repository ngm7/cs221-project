A Renaissance-Era Villa in Northern Italy

$3.3 MILLION (2.9 MILLION EUROS)

This Renaissance-era villa is in Ozzero, a small municipality about 20 miles southwest of Milan, in Northern Italy. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom home, which dates to the 15th century, features original details and period frescoes, and is listed with Italy’s Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. It is currently operated as a bed-and-breakfast, but could be converted into a single-family home.

The property is about half an acre and includes a 50-by-20-foot swimming pool, a large front lawn and a 9,150-square-foot garden.

The two-story, 11,248-square-foot house, which has cement walls and a clay-tile roof, was partially rebuilt in the 17th century and operated by the municipality of Ozzero as an institute for the disabled. In 1989, it returned to private ownership and was restored as a tourist destination.

“The villa is a testimony to the rich Italian historical and architectural heritage,” said Dimitri Corti, the chief executive of Lionard Luxury Real Estate, which has the listing. “Thanks to the care and detailed renovations, today it offers the possibility of living in an ancient house with great joy and enjoying modern comforts.”
