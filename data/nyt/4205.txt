As demonstrators gathered outside a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Tex., to express their outrage against the policy of separating children from their parents at the border, a bus carrying detained children exited the gated facility. It was surrounded by the protesters, some of who waved or blew kisses at the children inside; others sat down in the street, trying to stop it.

It was just after dark, on the banks of the Rio Grande in Laredo , Tex., just a couple of hundred yards from an outlet mall. Border Patrol agents were walking slowly along the river, following several men on inner tubes trying to cross over from Mexico. “¿Dónde están?” the agents called into the dark. Voices responded, giving their location. They knew full well they would be caught if they made it to the other side, so they turned back. I was struck by the banter, the banality of this recurring game of cat and mouse along the southern border.

Many of the Border Patrol agents I have met come from the communities they serve and have family on either side of the border. Some are immigrants themselves.

I remember the first time I saw people turning themselves in at the border. It was broad daylight and about 30 women and children from Central America crossed the Rio Grande and walked right up to Border Patrol agents. One woman had a child who was merely months old.

This summer, even after the policy of separating immigrant children from their parents became well known, families were still crossing the border to request asylum. And those who didn’t cross the border illegally, either out of respect for the law or a lack of means to hire smugglers, lined the dozen International Bridges in the Rio Grande Valley . They waited in the scorching heat, sometimes for days, to make their pleas.
