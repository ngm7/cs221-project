A young Austrian apprentice wagon maker, Josef Fischer, decided to strike out on his own in 1924 in the trade of “wagon making and the manufacture of wooden products.” He started off with toboggans and then, the next year, he made a pair of skis. They were cut from locally grown beech or brook ash — no one is really sure — and measured 220 centimeters long. He sold them for the princely sum of 140,000 crowns .

That Fischer started to make Alpine skis in the first place is somewhat surprising because his hometown, Ried im Innkreis, in Upper Austria just to the west of Linz, is surrounded by gentle rolling hills dotted with pear trees. There is nothing resembling a mountain for as far as the eye can see.

But the factory is still in the town, albeit at a grander site, and remains the only large-scale, family-run ski manufacturer in the world.
