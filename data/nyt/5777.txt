Slide 1 of 14,

In Shoreditch, the architects Zoe Chan Eayrs and Merlin Eayrs transformed a 19th-century former shoe factory into an urban retreat: quiet, light, homey, verdant with plants and the brush-marked glow of a pistachio-green heritage lime plaster that adorns every angle of the space. In the bathroom, pictured here, a pale blue and avocado-colored bathtub by the Water Monopoly.
