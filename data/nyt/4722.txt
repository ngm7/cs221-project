Good morning. I can’t speak for what you’re seeing in rural Kentucky towns or on the sandy roads leading down to the beach that runs north from San Diego. I don’t know what’s happening in Timberline Lodge up on Mt. Hood in Oregon, or in the fragrant humidity of the Frosty’s Donuts on the main drag of Brunswick, Me.

Are there Christmas lights strung around the palm trees at the entrance of the ’Tween Waters Inn, on Captiva Island in Florida? Is there a scrum around the baggage carousel at the airport in Salt Lake City, or long lines for bagels at St-Viateur in Montreal?

In New York City, there’s a little emptiness, some lassitude at the bodega, and the streets are quieter than usual. The citizenry has started to go back to the farm, the holler, the suburbs, the places they once called home, for yuletide and family, for duty, for respect. Others are hunkering down in walk-ups and floor-throughs, waiting on next week, tables at their favorite Chinese restaurants open for all, a movie on Tuesday afternoon, no lines.

Regardless, we’re all going to need to cook. I like the idea of a big feed tonight: Nigella Lawson’s spaghetti and meatballs (above), with Samin Nosrat’s herbed garlic bread to go with, and a kind of salad, perhaps.
