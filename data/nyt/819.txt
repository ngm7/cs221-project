LONDON — Current and former employees of the British fashion chain Ted Baker are accusing the company’s founder and chief executive of inappropriate behavior, citing a “forced hugging” policy and a workplace culture that “leaves harassment unchallenged.”

According to a petition started by Ted Baker employees and published by the employee advocacy group Organise Platform, Ray Kelvin, who started the brand with a single Glasgow shirt shop in 1988, regularly “tries to massage people around the office, insists on long hugs with staff members, touches them inappropriately and openly asks his staff for sex.”

The petition, citing multiple episodes of harassment , also says Ted Baker’s human resources department ignored complaints about Mr. Kelvin’s behavior.

“Harassment at Ted Baker is well documented but willfully ignored by those in charge,” write the authors of the petition, which calls for the company to adopt new procedures that allow workers to report harassment to an “independent, external body.”
