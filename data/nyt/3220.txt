The word derelict has appeared in 165 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 9 in “In London, Olympic Park’s Legacy Is Sustainability” by Amie Tsang:

It was 2005, and London needed to redevelop a Victorian industrial area in the Stratford district of east London that had faded into a down-at-the-heels combination of small businesses, warehouses and brownfield land. It could not afford to spend 9 billion pounds, about $11.5 billion, on useless infrastructure when the Games had been sold as a way to bolster development in one of the poorest parts of east London.

As the financial crisis reared its head and austerity measures started to bite, it became all the more important that the Olympic venues could be sustainable.

Six years after the Games, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, as the area is now known, has lived up to that directive. The industrial land has been replaced with landscaped greenery. The rivers and canals, previously derelict, are dotted with tour boats and swan-shaped paddle boats.
