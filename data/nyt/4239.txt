“I bloom indoors in the winter like a forced forsythia,” the author and naturalist Annie Dillard wrote in 1973. “I come in to come out.”

Winter, as a season, is all about being inside — physically and metaphorically. It is about regrouping, hunkering down, searching internally for inspiration. Fragrance is all about bottling our deepest desires and selling them right back to us; and this season, people very much want to smell like timber and bonfires. They want perfumes that not only bloom indoors but smell like the inside of a cozy wooden house.

Log Cabin Perfumes, as I have taken to calling the growing category of scents that evoke a cold snap all year round, are fairly new to the market. A decade ago, only a few niche fragrances prominently featured notes like Scotch pine, birch tar, gunpowder, palo santo and wood smoke. In 2009, Serge Lutens released Fille en Aiguilles, a cult hit that smells like a Christmas tree farm, and slowly the hibernal trend began to trickle through the indie perfume world. Now, the demand for wearable wintry mixes has exploded.

“These scents are experiencing a renewal and will be with us for some time,” said John Biebel, the perfumer behind the indie fragrance house January Scent Project. “It’s a bit of escapism, but actually to many it may be a desire to return to ‘real’ life, full of unfiltered smells of the forest, the mountains, the freshly cracked wood branch and pine cones underfoot.”
