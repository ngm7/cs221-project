Their once-promising season in tatters, the Green Bay Packers fired Coach Mike McCarthy on Sunday and named Joe Philbin, the team’s offensive coordinator, as the interim coach.

The announcement came after the Packers were upset by the visiting Arizona Cardinals, 20-17, ending McCarthy’s nearly 13-year run in Green Bay.

“The 2018 season has not lived up to the expectations and standards of the Green Bay Packers,” the team president Mark Murphy said in a statement. “We will immediately begin the process of selecting the next head coach of the Green Bay Packers.”

McCarthy, 55, had a 125-76-2 record, for a .621 winning percentage, since arriving in Green Bay in 2006. The Packers made the playoffs in nine of his seasons, and won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season. Only Curly Lambeau, the team’s original coach, led the team longer than McCarthy.
