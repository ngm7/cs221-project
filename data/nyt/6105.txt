June Whitfield, the diminutive British actress whose seven-decade career reached its peak as Edina Monsoon’s dotty, acerbic mother in the hit comedy series “Absolutely Fabulous,” died on Friday in London. She was 93.

Her death was confirmed by her agent, according to the BBC.

Mother — that was the official name of Ms. Whitfield’s character — looked the part of the kind, proper, white-haired London granny in sweater sets and pearls, but she had a gift for the cutting remark. In one classic scene, Edina (Jennifer Saunders) fretted about her weight, declaring, “Inside of me, there’s a thin person just screaming to get out.” Mother, sipping tea at the kitchen table, replied calmly, “Just the one, dear?”

In the series, which ran from 1992 to 1996 and returned in various forms in the 21st century, Mother also turned out to be a practicing kleptomaniac who was not above climbing in and out of windows when necessary. “Oh, Mother is fabulous,” Ms. Whitfield told The Telegraph years later. “She appears more grounded, but she’s as mad as the rest of them.”

Ms. Whitfield may not have been a familiar face to American audiences when “Ab Fab,” as the show was nicknamed, had its United States premiere on Comedy Central in 1994. She was, however, a household name in her home country, thanks in part to “Happy Ever After” and “Terry and June,” the sitcoms in which she played Terry Scott’s suburban wife. Together the two series ran from 1974 to 1987.
