“When We Were Strangers” is the subject of a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for its 2019 publication by Red Hook Editions. The photo book is about “big picture” love explored “via the prism of our relationship,” Jake writes. Prism is an apt descriptor, too, given how often the imagery depicts light reflected and refracted. The couple laughs at their own audacity when we discuss the enormity — and impossibility — of their undertaking: to explore what it means to be in love. Could there be more well-trod, timeworn, cliché-ridden territory?

Jake and Juan emphasize that while there are countless books about straight relationships, there is “a dearth of books about queer love.” Their narrative is neither straight nor straightforward: it’s queer as in gay and queer as in beguilingly peculiar — elusive, allusive, poetic. The images invite interpretation rather than simple consumption: the hard lines and almost, but not quite, closed doors of a dark hallway, with light pushing through, hint at accessibility and lack thereof: a door ajar, an invitation to entrance at the same time that it might well close, shutting us out.

Juan, who was born in El Salvador, writes entirely in Spanish and his passages are untranslated. Jake, who was born in the United States, writes entirely in English. His passages are also untranslated. The couple invites us to consider how we read and misread each other. They agree that “we are, and love is, fundamentally untranslatable. And there are ways in which we remain, always, unknown to each other.”
