To Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is one of President Trump’s lawyers, it was an example of how low Twitter would stoop to carry out its anti-Trump agenda.

It was, decidedly, no such thing. It was just a typo, followed by an opportunistic prank by an improv actor in Atlanta.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani said the social network had “allowed someone to invade my text with a disgusting anti-President message.” He was referring to a Nov. 30 tweet in which Mr. Giuliani — by failing to put a space after a period, and starting the next sentence with the word “In” — had inadvertently created a hyperlink.
