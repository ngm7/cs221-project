“The most sacred duty of government is to protect people,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “especially defenseless children. There is nothing more barbaric than separating children from their parents. There is no excuse for this horror and certainly no reason.”

Was that the mayor’s response to a stomach-churning video of a mother’s arrest in a New York City welfare office on Friday as police officers tried to yank her child from her? No, it was a tweet by Mr. de Blasio in May about the Trump administration’s family separation policy for asylum seekers at the border.

He’s shown much less passion in his response to the arrest.

In the video, a woman identified by officials as Jazmine Headley is seen on her back on the floor of a Brooklyn benefits office surrounded by officers from the New York Police Department and the city’s Human Resources Administration. Ms. Headley desperately tries to hold on to her 1-year-old as a police officer tries to tug the boy from her arms.
