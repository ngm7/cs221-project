36A: An “Old Russian autocrat” is often a “tsar” and sometimes a CZAR. A CZAR is sometimes an old Russian autocrat but often a “politico” or “honcho.” No big deal, here — I did have “pest” for BOZO at 25D for a minute, but both “tsar” and CZAR are known to me. It made for an interesting topic to research, though, as far as usage is concerned. I always thought that CZAR was the newer word and more idiomatic, but it turns out that’s debatable. In The Times, as per our stylebook, “tsar” is verboten.

64A: This clue reminded me to mention how much I love you guys and your “oh, I finished today’s in 2:37 and I usually finish a Tuesday in 2:35” comments. I got to this entry and spent about 90 minutes on YouTube, mainly listening to Hot Chocolate, with a little Vanilla Fudge, before coming back to the puzzle to fill in BAND. Do you take those intermissions, and do you count any of those intermissions in your solve times? I have this neon pink Christmas cactus that blooms around now, no matter how neglected, that makes me think of this song! It brightens my day every single time I hear it.
