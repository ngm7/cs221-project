“Women in their 20s must make saving a priority, plan for career interruptions and look at saving as making an investment in their future self,” Ms. Dychtwald said.

It’s not just women, of course. About two-thirds of working millennials from ages 21 to 32 have nothing saved for retirement, according to a National Institute on Retirement Security report.

In part, the setback for both women and men in their 20s is the rise of the gig economy, and access to and eligibility for an employer retirement plan. While more than 94 percent of millennials like Ms. Corner, who are eligible for a workplace retirement plan, are saving, many don’t have access to an employer plan.

About 25 percent of millennials were not eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan because they worked part time, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security report. And more than half of millennial women, 56.1 percent, work part time, compared with 44 percent of millennial men.

Sara Blandin, 28, a marketing director in Asheville, N.C., for instance, does not have access to an employer retirement plan. “A lot of my female friends are in the same boat,” she said. “I do have a savings account, and I am thinking about opening a Roth IRA as soon as possible.”

Ms. Blandin had a retirement fund with one of her former employers. “Then I moved on to a different job, and I took that money out” — about $7,000, she said. “Isn’t that the craziest thing? I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn’t have an option. I needed to pay off the last of my student loans and credit card debts that had built up from buying furniture for my apartment and purchasing nice office clothes — I didn’t even have dress pants.”

More than half of investors ages 18 to 34 say they have taken money from a retirement account and paid the tax and penalty for doing so, according to research from E-Trade Financial. That figure has been growing steadily since 2015, when it was 1 in 3.
