Most diagnostic tests for TB rely on detecting the bacterium or its DNA in sputum. But it can be difficult for H.I.V.-positive people to produce enough sputum. The dipstick test picks up lipoarabinomannan, a component of the TB bacterium, in urine.

TB is the leading cause of death in H.I.V.-positive people, claiming 300,000 lives in 2017. The W.H.O. recommends the test only for people who are H.I.V.-positive, gravely ill and have fewer than 100 CD4 cells — a kind of immune system cell — per cubic millimeter of blood. (The typical range for CD4 cells is 500 to 1,500.)

In this group, according to evidence the W.H.O. reviewed in 2015, the test correctly diagnoses TB in 56 percent of patients. “It’s a test with suboptimal accuracy,” said Christopher Gilpin, senior scientist at the WHO’s Global TB Program. “This is probably part of the limited uptake.”

Another reason, he said, is that few clinics in resource-poor regions have the equipment needed to determine CD4 counts.

Advocacy groups take issue with both points, saying the W.H.O. is making perfect the enemy of good.

“It’s not a perfect test, but there’s literally zero harm in doing it and it has saved a lot of lives,” said Erica Lessem, deputy executive director for programs at Treatment Action Group, an organization based in New York City.
