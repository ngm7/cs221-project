New York fashion has a new family-run company.

On Tuesday Tory Burch named Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton executive, as her chief executive, moving herself into the role of chief creative officer and executive chairman. That Mr. Roussel also happens to be her new husband (they were married in November after becoming engaged in 2016) is both par for the course in the industry and something of a redesign.

American fashion hasn’t had this kind of couple at the top of one of its marquee brands since the days of Donna Karan and Stephan Weiss. Though thanks to social media, direct-to-consumer retail and the demand for increasing corporate transparency, what it means to be that couple these days is a very different question.

One Mr. Roussel and Ms. Burch, whether they like it or not, are now poised to answer.

There’s no question Mr. Roussel is eminently qualified for the job. The former C.E.O. of the LVMH fashion group, he was charged with building up the luxury conglomerate’s smaller brands, including Celine and Marc Jacobs, and division sales tripled during his tenure. Mr. Roussel has long been fascinated by the contemporary fashion space, especially in the American market. He and Ms. Burch met when he was exploring a potential acquisition for LVMH, and he was the driving force behind hiring Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony for Kenzo, transforming that into a more accessible brand, as well as preserving DKNY when Donna Karan left the company and LVMH closed the higher-priced main Donna Karan line (they later sold the lower priced line to G-III).

When he left his fashion group post in early 2018, becoming a special adviser to Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, Mr. Roussel said he was intending to move back into an operational role in the future. Presumably he has been talking business with Ms. Burch on an ad hoc basis over dinner for a while now.
