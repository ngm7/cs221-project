Erin Trimble mails out 175 family holiday newsletters every year. It can get expensive — that’s a lot of stamps — but for this mom of seven from Peoria, Ariz., it’s worth it.

“It’s such a great way to update people on what you and your family are up to,” she said. It’s the sole point of contact she has all year with many people on her list, and it’s the only insight they have into their interior life. Recent revelations: how she hiked the Grand Canyon while 10 weeks pregnant, which of her kids love soccer and who in her family can’t get enough Sour Patch Kids.

Ms. Trimble packs her newsletter full of family trivia, and she enjoys the challenge of using a variety of templates. One year her newsletter consisted of a series of to-do lists for each family member, with checked boxes highlighting individual accomplishments over the past year. On daughter Ruby’s list: start preschool; do zerberts on people; secure title of “takes longest to get to bed.” Check, check and check.

Another year, Ms. Trimble organized informational tidbits from A to Z. (“B is for Braces. Libby has a sparkly smile now!”) You can see more of her creative family newsletter ideas here.
