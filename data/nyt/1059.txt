‘A Service Entrance’ at the Wall

For the third night in a row, Trevor Noah sat wordlessly onstage throughout “The Daily Show,” forced to remain silent because of a throat ailment. Desi Lydic, a “Daily Show” correspondent, sat beside him and delivered the evening’s punchlines. (Noah interjected here and there via cellphone, typing in his quips and having the device read them aloud.)

Lydic ridiculed President Trump on Thursday after a New York Times report revealed that he has employed an undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, for five years as his housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Morales said she decided to reveal her secret after growing frustrated over mistreatment by a manager and Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.
