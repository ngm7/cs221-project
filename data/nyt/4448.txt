In early 2018, officials at North Carolina’s elections board were worried about the integrity of the coming midterm elections in rural Bladen County — particularly because of the possibility that a political operative named L. McCrae Dowless Jr. might run a worrisome absentee-ballot program similar to one they had seen him run there two years earlier.

So in late January, they sent a fat packet of documents to state and federal prosecutors laying out what they believed to be possible criminal conduct in voter turnout work Mr. Dowless had done in 2016.

But Mr. Dowless was never indicted or sanctioned in any way. And now, the turnout work he did two years later on behalf of a Republican candidate, Mark Harris, is at the center of the investigation in the Ninth Congressional District. The inquiry has the potential to force a new election in the contest, which Mr. Harris had apparently won by 905 votes over the Democrat, Dan McCready.

On Wednesday, the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement made public the packet of documents it had originally provided to the Wake County district attorney and the United States attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
