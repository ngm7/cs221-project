“I’ve said before and will say again, I’d rather be poked in the eye with a burning stick than tweet,” Nora Roberts admitted recently. She was responding to Tomi Adeyemi, who had tweeted a picture of Roberts’s thriller, “Of Blood and Bone” — which debuts this week at No. 2 — next to a picture of her own Y.A. novel, “Children of Blood and Bone.” In the Nov. 27 tweet, Adeyemi wrote, “It would be nice if an artist could create something special without another artist trying to shamelessly profit off it.”

Roberts, who says she was “gutted” to have been accused of plagiarism, spoke to Adeyemi and explained that “Of Blood and Bone” had been titled and delivered to her publisher fully a year before “Children of Blood and Bone” came out. In addition, book titles cannot be copyrighted.

On Nov. 28, Adeyemi tweeted, “Nora was kind enough to reach out & explain that today was the first she’d heard of my book. After talking to her, I believe our titles were created in isolation. I’m grateful she explained & I’ve apologized.”
