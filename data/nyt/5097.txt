Two White House advisers, responding to news reports that President Trump was inquiring about firing the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said he now understands he lacks the authority to do so.

One of the advisers, Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, made his comments on Sunday, echoing comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Their statements came after news reports began circulating that Mr. Trump had asked aides whether he could fire Mr. Powell. The Fed has traditionally operated independently of the presidency as it seeks to keep inflation stable and the economy running at maximum employment.

Mr. Trump previously told advisers that Mr. Powell will “turn me into Hoover,” a reference to the Great Depression-era president Herbert Hoover. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly criticized the Fed for increasing interest rates, criticism the president doubled down on this weekend even as he denied suggesting firing Mr. Powell.
