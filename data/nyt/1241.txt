Re “My Life as a Stay-at-Home Mom,” by Caroline Hamilton Langerman (Sunday Review, Dec. 2):

In the 1970s the women’s movement fought to give women choices and mastery over their lives. Yet 40 years later, whether children thrive better with their mothers in the home or at the office continues to be a flash point among women and in American society.

Chronic illness made the choice for me; I was a stay-at-home mom. Sometimes you experience treasured moments in your young children’s lives. Other days it’s lots of manual labor: changing diapers, emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry. No glamour or self-fulfillment in sight.

Until women accept one another’s choices and do not invalidate or cast judgment, we won’t fully realize the vision of female empowerment and freedom begun in the 1970s. Dissent within our ranks feeds the sexist trope that female careers after childbirth neglect a baby’s needed maternal care.

Remember that working-class women have been financially supporting their families and simultaneously raising children for centuries.
