But some Republicans lauded Ms. Stefanik’s willingness to buck the party’s leadership.

“Elise Stefanik is taking a stake in a party that needs new ownership and that’s a great thing,” said William F. B. O’Reilly, a longtime Republican operative in New York. “It needs people who don’t ask permission. It needs people who are willing to be bulls in the china shop.”

There will only be 13 female Republicans in the House in the next Congress, down from 23. Only one woman, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, holds a top House leadership position.

Across the aisle, 35 of the new female members of the House are Democrats compared with only two Republicans, and nine of the Democrats are under the age of 40. Among them is Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who, in similar ways to Ms. Stefanik, has been tabbed as a rising star in her party.

“We need Elise Stefanik to speak out on our behalf because as a young women in Congress who is a Republican, she is seriously outnumbered and that makes her role more and more difficult,” said Jennifer Nassour, the former head of the Republican Party in Massachusetts.

“She is taking the frustration of many women in the party and she is putting it into action and holding the party leaders’ feet to the fire in making them take a close look at what’s going on on the Republican side,” Ms. Nassour added. “I commend her for that because she is really taking a step out there, and not everyone wants to take that leap of faith.”

Amid her political maneuvering, Ms. Stefanik is also embarking on a literal move: She and her husband, Matthew Manda, recently bought a new home in Schuylerville, N.Y., roughly 100 miles south of her previous address in Willsboro, N.Y.

Though a move often does not draw much speculation, her new residence sits near the edge of her congressional district, which could subject her to the perils of redistricting after the 2020 census is completed.
