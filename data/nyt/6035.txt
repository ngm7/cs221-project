VARIETY PUZZLE — We gravitate toward the second Sunday puzzle for a challenge that breaks the standard crossword mold; sometimes the differences aren’t readily apparent, but Split Decisions is one that’s completely off the grid, if you will. For me, that difference leads to uncertainty, which usually leads to extra care and time in my approach, since I tend to be a little afraid of change. But at least we’re here, right?

Here’s the simple rule: There are no clues. Instead, you’re given two pairs of letters and a varying number of blank spaces shared between them; to solve, you must find the letters to fill those spaces that make two separate words. You’ll inevitably have multiple possibilities, but (as far as I know) there will only be one solution to each pair that allows the entire puzzle to fill in harmoniously.

To get a toehold, I usually look for short words with odd letters that lend themselves to mild risk taking: AJAX/HOAX comes to mind, as does SEIZE/SERGE, SAMBA/SAUNA, MECCA/MEDIA, and ACHE/ACID. These are all spots where the letters given greatly limit your logical word choices.

The approach I take, when I find letters that work well but worry about other possibilities, is to just fill them in and promise not to be stubborn about changing them later: today, I only screwed up SKIES/SHOES (I had a “p” for the E, for a while). I think I felt most gratification from figuring out DECIMATE/DECORATE and DECOROUS/DEXTROUS, and the crossing of CONCLAVE/CONCEIVE with CHAPLAIN/COMPLAIN was pretty amusing.
