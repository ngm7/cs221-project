Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• Declaring victory in the four-year American-led war against the Islamic State, President Trump ordered a rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 United States ground troops from Syria. But the abrupt, chaotic nature of the move — and the opposition it provoked on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon — raised questions about how Mr. Trump would follow through with the plan.

• The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government funded through early February. Here’s more about the measure, and what to expect when expecting a shutdown.

• The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, defying Mr. Trump’s call for the central bank to take a pause. The decision stems from confidence in continued economic growth but seems to ignore recent turbulence in the financial markets.
