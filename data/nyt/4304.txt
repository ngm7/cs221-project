A real-life coda has imposed an awkward structure on “Avicii: True Stories,” a sadly familiar price-of-fame documentary about the Swedish D.J. and electronic dance music producer, whose birth name was Tim Bergling. The movie first screened last year, before Avicii’s death in April 2018 of an apparent suicide at 28.

The first chapter (as a title card calls it) charts Avicii’s rise over the last decade, especially after his 2013 single “Wake Me Up” became a global smash. He is portrayed as a touring workhorse, and that lifestyle exacts a heavy toll. We’re with him in Australia after he receives a diagnosis of pancreatitis. Chronic pain strains his ability to perform.

In the second chapter, after Avicii takes a break, he gets a dog, announces his retirement from touring and, fighting pushback from his team, reluctantly performs his last shows.
