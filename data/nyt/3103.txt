Re “Trump Blames Cohen: ‘He Is Supposed to Know the Law’” (news article, Dec. 14):

First, President Trump denies having an affair with Stormy Daniels. Then he denies that any hush money payments were made to her. Then that he had no knowledge of any payments to her. Then that these payments did not come out of campaign finance funds but from his personal funds. And now, in the latest ever-evolving version, that if they did come out of campaign funds, that it was his lawyer Michael Cohen’s fault for not advising him that this might be illegal .

It reminds me of an old joke about the sociopath’s response when accused of a crime: I tell you that I wasn’t even there, and — if I was there — then I didn’t do anything, and if I might have done something, it was just an accident, and . . .
