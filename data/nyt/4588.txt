There was much in Ms. Taymor’s exotic staging to fascinate a young newcomer to opera. When the soprano Kathryn Lewek first appears as the Queen of the Night, it’s as a strange moth-like demon with flapping wings. In the character’s later aria of fury, when she orders her daughter Pamina to kill the high priest Sarastro, Ms. Lewek handled the skittish runs and leaps to high F with uncanny ease and accuracy.

For those less taken with this staging (I’m one of them), the exoticism goes too far. Some characters become heavy-handed archetypes, like the three ladies who wait on the queen and wear midnight-blue dresses and thick makeup to blacken their faces. They manipulate masks with their hands, as if their heads are detached.

It’s hard to believe it when these demonic figures playfully compete over Tamino, the young prince and hero. Yet the production, with costumes by Ms. Taymor, is filled with her signature magical puppets and colorful effects. I do love the scene when Tamino, playing his magic flute, tames a menagerie of huge dancing animals in the forest.

The cast was excellent. The audience laughed continually at the antics of the hapless bird catcher Papageno, here the hearty baritone Nathan Gunn (returning to one of his best Met roles). Ben Bliss sang Tamino with a tender yet ample lyric tenor voice and earnestness. The soprano Erin Morley, a lovely, sweet-toned Pamina, conveyed the poignant confusion of a young woman trapped between an avenging mother and Sarastro (the powerful bass Morris Robinson).

Harry Bicket, the artistic director of the English Concert, which has won a following in New York for its annual performances of Handel operas at Carnegie Hall, led a buoyant and winning performance. Even with all the trims, the music seemed to flow.
