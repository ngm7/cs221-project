Last week I noted that the Oscars provide a telling lens through which we can examine the year in pop culture at large. Whether that relevance is expressed through the actual nominations or via the tough conversations about what is canonized and what isn’t, this awards show never fails to provide insight into where we are as a culture.

With that in mind, there is at least one clear message that we can divine from the past year in all things Oscar: 2018 has been an absolute mess.

The academy’s woes didn’t start this week when Kevin Hart was hired to host the Oscars and then dropped out two days later after he refused to apologize for anti-gay jokes. In fact, ever since John Bailey was elected president of the academy in 2017, the Oscars have flung themselves headlong into one controversy after another, many of which were of their own making.

First, there was an incredibly wan ceremony in March, hosted by a disengaged Jimmy Kimmel. It was a significant anniversary for the Oscars — the academy’s 90th show — yet the telecast had no special pomp and circumstance nor even much verve. Aside from the winners, I’m hard-pressed to recall a single significant moment from the telecast, except for the indelible image of Armie Hammer wielding a hot-dog cannon. It was the lowest-rated Oscars ever, and it felt like that as you watched it.
