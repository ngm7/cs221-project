Outside Queen’s Park, few doubted that the right decision had been reached. Hampden is Scotland’s “spiritual home,” as the former national manager Craig Brown and Kenny Dalglish, perhaps its finest player, said. And though the thought of the team’s leaving was, to many, anathema, the fate of a minor fourth-division team was, at best, a secondary consideration.

That is not quite how they see it at Queen’s Park. Gerry Crawley, the club president, acknowledged that leaving for Lesser Hampden was “not a situation we sought,” though he said he was confident the £5 million would be enough to create a new home on the existing training complex there and allow the team to “operate in a similar manner.”

Others are more fearful. Keith McAllister, 61, has been attending Queen’s Park games for almost three decades. He grew up a few streets away. He estimates that he has missed only three away matches since 1979. He has, he said, warned his daughter that if she marries during the season, it will have to be on a Friday.

For home games, he runs a souvenir stall in Hampden Park. Most weeks, he said, he will have a handful of foreign visitors paying homage to Queen’s Park. “There are a lot who come up from England, but I’ve had people from Spain and Germany, too,” he said.

They come not just because of the litany of famous players this club has produced — like Alex Ferguson, now a life member, and Andy Robertson, Liverpool defender and current Scotland captain — but because of its contribution to the game as a whole. Indeed, perhaps more than any other club, Queen’s Park helped to craft soccer as it is played today.
