OTTAWA — As the extradition case against a Chinese tech executive moves into its next phase in Canada’s courts, manufacturers, farmers, loggers and fishermen across Canada are looking on with apprehension.

The arrest by the Canadian authorities of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the telecommunications giant Huawei, at the request of the United States government has angered China, and ratcheted up tensions between the United States and China while they are negotiating a trade truce.

Canada finds itself stuck in the middle of the dispute. The United States is its neighbor and ally, while China is a major and growing market for export-dependent Canada.

While neither the government of Canada nor any major industry has received even a hint that Canadian exports will be targeted by China in retaliation, just the prospect of such action is unnerving in Canada.
