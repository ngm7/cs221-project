Considering that Daina Agee and Michael Mastrandrea met in Malaysia, though both were born in New York and she was living in Taiwan at the time while he was on an extended international backpacking trip, it’s probably not that surprising that a geographic misunderstanding surfaced early in their relationship.

In 2013, their paths crossed at a hostel in Kuala Lumpur that is known for its rooftop bar and party atmosphere. She was on her way to Nepal for a hiking trip, and he was headed to Bali to celebrate his birthday. He told her he was from Cincinnati. She told him that she taught English to schoolchildren in Taipei.

“We had things in common — we’re both originally from Long Island, we have similar world views, we’re outward looking and really progressive, we like minimalist living, and are interested in politics,” she said, noting that the two stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking. “There was just something about him that reminded me of New York, and of home.”

The two commenced a friendship through Facebook messages, and some weeks later, when she was back in Taipei, he suggested that he might visit Taiwan for a week or so.
