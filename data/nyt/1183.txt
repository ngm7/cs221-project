Why tech unicorns are speeding up their I.P.O.s

Some of America’s biggest privately held start-ups have resisted going public for years. That’s about to change, and perhaps faster than we had thought it would.

The news: Lyft, most recently valued at $15 billion, announced that it had confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the S.E.C. for an I.P.O. The ride-hailing company had indicated that it planned to go public in the middle of next year, but it is moving up the timing. Lyft’s competitor Uber, which could be worth as much as $120 billion, is also moving its I.P.O. up from fall 2019.

Why are they going public? “For years, many unicorns were in no rush to go public because they could grow easily with money from private investors and away from the scrutiny of Wall Street,” the NYT’s Erin Griffith and Mike Isaac write. “Those attitudes have shifted as investors and tech employees have increased pressure on the companies to go public so that they can cash in their shares.”

Why the urgency now? Uber is said to be nervous about a looming recession. Lyft apparently pulled things forward because of the recent stock market sell-off (and because it wants to beat Uber to the punch). “Few executives want to take their companies public when investors’ appetite for shares may be ebbing,” Ms. Griffith and Mr. Isaac write.
