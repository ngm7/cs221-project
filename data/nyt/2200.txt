LAS VEGAS — Sometimes it just takes one big deal for the dam to break. And late Wednesday night, during baseball’s annual winter meetings, that deal apparently arrived when reliever Jeurys Familia decided to return to the Mets for a contract worth $30 million over three years.

Soon after, Joe Kelly agreed to a three-year, $25 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team he tortured during the World Series while pitching in relief for the Boston Red Sox. The remaining dominoes in a saturated market for relief pitchers — including big names like Craig Kimbrel, Zach Britton and Andrew Miller — may now follow suit and shortly sign new deals, too.

But it was the Mets, who have taken an aggressive approach under their new general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, who pounced first.

Familia, who left the Mets for the Oakland Athletics in a trade in July, probably will not be formally reintroduced as a Met until early next week because he still has to pass a physical. Nor will he be the Mets’ closer, as he had been before he departed. But Van Wagenen, careful to couch his words because the deal was still pending, was clearly happy that the Mets now have a talented, and experienced, reliever in place to serve as the setup man for the team’s new closer, the recently acquired Edwin Diaz. A Mets bullpen that was among the worst in baseball last season has clearly been fortified.
