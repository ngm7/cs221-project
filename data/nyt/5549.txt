Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.

Covering a major prosecution such as the drug conspiracy trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican crime lord known as El Chapo, is, I imagine, a bit like commuting to work on a space station. It takes a long time to make it to your job and actually get inside the courtroom. Once you’re there, you tend to feel as if you’re floating in an isolated capsule, far away from Earth.

The trial began two months ago in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, but for the dozen or so reporters who have shown up every day — and plan to be there until the end comes in another month or two — it has seemed like an eternity. Routines have formed. Inside jokes have developed. As a community of El Chapo watchers, we study the defendant’s choice of clothing and try to read the cryptic expressions that every now and then flicker across his face.

I have been covering trials on and off for almost 20 years, but this trial, more than most, has been a true immersive experience. Here are a few notes — jotted down on a morning of quiet testimony — about what an average day at the El Chapo trial is like.
