Re “Leader of Interior Dept. Resigns Under Cloud of Inquiries” (front page, Dec. 16):

The resignation of Secretary Ryan Zinke, an anti-environment, anti-wildlife ideologue who takes his place along with forme r Secretaries James Watt (Reagan administratio n), Gale Norton and Dirk Kempthorne (George W. Bush administration) as one of the worst secretaries in American history, is great news for the overwhelming majority of Americans who care about the environment.

Let’s hope that Mr. Zinke will ride his horse back to Montana (as he rode it to his first day of work at Interior) rather than ship it back at taxpayer expense.

President Trump will no doubt appoint a new anti-environment, anti-wildlife secretary, but the Democrats must make a maximum effort to deny such an appointment and secure a new secretary who will protect and preserve the environment for future generations of Americans.
