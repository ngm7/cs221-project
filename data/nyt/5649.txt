BEST BOOKS’ BEST READS Some years prompt a rush of nostalgia before they’ve even ended — you hope they never will. Others you can’t wait to see out the door. Wherever 2018 fell on that spectrum for you, literarily speaking it was a banner year — 12 months during which debuts by women, by first-generation Americans, by a Native American man, by a historian who had no formal schooling until college and by an Iraq-War-vet-turned-prison-inmate all found critical acclaim and enthusiastic readers alongside stellar work by established writers. The magazine EW, noting with approval that this year “both best-of and best-seller lists are rife with the experiences of America as a whole,” called 2018 “Peak Book.”

In that spirit of celebration, we asked the authors of our 10 Best Books to tell us about a book they read this year and loved. All but one responded. Here, in alphabetical order, is what they had to say:

Shane Bauer ( “American Prison: A Reporter’s Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment”): “A novel I read this year and loved was ‘The Yacoubian Building,’ by Alaa Al Aswany. Al Aswany gives a complex and beautifully written portrait of Egyptian society by focusing on the lives that intersect in one apartment building in Cairo.”

David W. Blight (“Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom”): “I read Kevin Power’s ‘A Shout in the Ruins,’ his second novel. Some critics did not like it as literature but I found it profound as a meditation on how the past is never over, on the South’s enduring burden of history, and how ‘truth’ — illusive, dangerous, deadly — is always at stake. It’s all about America’s dilemma with the history and memory of slavery and the Civil War, always waiting there to threaten or destroy us.”

Lisa Brennan-Jobs (“Small Fry”): “Phillip Lopate’s ‘A Mother’s Tale’ does not pull punches about his complicated family, and is tender and compelling.”
