Monique Pillard, a booking agent who helped steer the careers of supermodels like Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Christie Brinkley, died on Dec. 3 at her apartment in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of Manhattan. She was 81.

Her death was announced by Christine K. Schott, a friend and former business colleague, who said Ms. Pillard had been in declining health for several years.

For more than three decades, Ms. Pillard (PILL-ard) worked at two of the modeling industry’s pre-eminent agencies: Ford Models, which she joined in the late 1960s, and Elite Model Management, originally based in Paris, whose founder, John Casablancas, recruited her in 1977 when he decided to open an office in New York City.

Ms. Pillard was known as a tough negotiator — she brokered precedent-setting deals like Paulina Porizkova’s multimillion-dollar 1988 contract to be the face of Estée Lauder — but she had warm relationships with many of the models she worked with.
