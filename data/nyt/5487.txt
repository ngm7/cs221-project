Indoors: Exposed Basalite concrete walls, terrazzo floors, wood paneling and clerestory windows contribute to the home’s modernist ambience. In recent years the kitchen and bathrooms have been updated.

Entry is beneath a cantilevered enclosed porch, up a spiral staircase and then through a choice of two front doors. Both doors lead to a long hallway with embedded display cases that can be used for art or trophies. To the left is a family room that includes a fireplace with a copper hood flanked by planters and a built-in desk. An almost identical room (sans desk) is to the right and is used as a living room. Between these rooms is a dining area with a wall of glass overlooking a back courtyard area. The open kitchen has quartz-topped wood cabinetry and a wood peninsula and island.

The master bedroom includes four closets and an en-suite bathroom. The house also has two guest bedrooms (one used to be divided by an accordion wall) and a guest bathroom, plus a children’s wing with a bedroom off a sink area and separate tub room and water closet.
