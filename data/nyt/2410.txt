Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan presented bills last week that would restrict the powers of incoming Democratic governors. What’s driving Republicans? Fear that they will lose the gerrymandered districts they depend on for a trove of seats.

• Washington lobbyists have carved out a lucrative new niche representing clients that face U.S. sanctions, like Serbian arms dealers and the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Lobbyists with ties to President Trump have especially benefited.

• Mr. Trump insisted that any payment prosecutors accuse him of illegally making to two women to silence them about alleged extramarital affairs ahead of the 2016 election was “a simple private transaction.” But the hush-money payments could be subject to campaign-finance laws.
