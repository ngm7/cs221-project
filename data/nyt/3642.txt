DURHAM, N.C. — It is difficult to reconcile the awe that comes out of the mouths of adults about Zion Williamson when you’re watching the player slumped in a chair after a 33-point blowout victory, answering goofy questions with a goofy smile.

“Did you feel like a tight end on that breakaway?”

“Is it true you were offered scholarships to play football?”

“Do you feel pressure to put on a show when you get the ball?”

Williamson, Duke’s star freshman and (many expect) a No. 1 N.B.A. draft pick by June, had just turned in the kind of performance against Yale that college hoops aficionados have come to expect from him: 20 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and the requisite head-above-the-rim tomahawk dunk that has made him a staple of television highlight reels and internet video compilations.

After absorbing each question, Williamson looked at his teammate Mike Buckmire, who pretended he was playing the role of Williamson’s consigliere.
