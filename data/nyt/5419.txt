Good morning. It is Boxing Day in Britain and across the tattered remains of its empire across the globe, a second day of Christmastide, historically the moment to dole out gifts to the servant class and now perhaps to box up ill-fitting sweaters and shoes for return or exchange. It’s back to work today for some, the start of a vacation for others, as much of the Western world finds itself caught in a weird end-of-year limbo, checking out best-of-2018 lists and waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square next week.

Might as well cook! If you’re off work still, I’d suggest Dorie Greenspan’s new recipe for one big spice cookie (above) to share after dinner — chicken Marengo, perhaps?

If not, if you had to go in, ride the cubicle, finish the welds, do the research, tally the books, you can make dinner faster and more intuitively, and cook a no-recipe recipe when you get home at day’s end. Today I’m thinking you could toss some peeled shrimp with lime juice and oil, some shakes of ground cumin and chile powder and red-pepper flakes, then roast them on a sheet pan in a very hot oven alongside a foil-wrapped packet of corn tortillas, to serve with sour cream or crema, a simple slaw, lime wedges and hot sauce to pass on the side. Shouldn’t take much more than 6 or 8 minutes to roast through a pound of shrimp.

Want real recipes, the instruction laid out plain? Melissa Clark has a new one for a pasta casserole with Cheddar and caramelized onions. And David Tanis has another, for elegant cornmeal waffles with smoked salmon. Those appear to be winners, and I hope you cook them soon.
