JESSICA KIRSON at the Creek and the Cave (Dec. 30 and Jan. 2-4, 7 p.m.).

You can watch her prepare for this performance over four shows during her weeklong stint in Long Island City, Queens.

‘MY MOMMA’S BISCUITS: 7 DAYS OF KWANZAA’ at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater Hell’s Kitchen (Dec. 28, 11:59 p.m.). If you’re as confused about Kwanzaa as most people, since it doesn’t get nearly the attention that Hanukkah and Christmas do (or even Festivus or Chrismukkah!), this comedy collective will set you straight with a variety show centered around this African-American holiday, first celebrated in 1966.
