SAN FRANCISCO — He never said never.

For years, orchestras have courted the visionary conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. Critics have frequently put his name at the top of their wish lists when big jobs opened up.

But Mr. Salonen, who helped make the Los Angeles Philharmonic one of the nation’s most innovative orchestras during a 17-year reign, always demurred, saying he wanted more time to compose, not another conducting post.

So the news that Mr. Salonen, 60, will become the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony, which the orchestra announced on Wednesday, is sure to stun the classical music field.

The move solidifies the West Coast’s position as the center of American orchestral experimentation. It solves San Francisco’s tricky problem of finding a successor for a beloved music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, who will have shaped the ensemble for 25 years when he steps down in 2020.
