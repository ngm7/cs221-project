“To us, his was the brightest of a thousand points of light,” former President George W. Bush said in his eulogy, referring to a phrase his father had popularized.

Watch: Scenes from the funeral, including parts of Mr. Bush’s speech.

Another angle: The service was a rare reunion for the men and women who served in the first Bush administration.

What’s next: Another service will be held today in Houston. Mr. Bush will then be taken by train to College Station, Tex., to be interred at his presidential library next to his wife, Barbara, and Robin, a daughter who died of leukemia at age 3.

President Trump seeks to calm the markets

The president tried on Wednesday to ease concerns that his trade truce with China was floundering, saying that Beijing was sending “very strong signals” about the deal he reached with President Xi Jinping over the weekend.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have been talking up the trade truce, but the Chinese have mostly been silent.

Global stock markets fell sharply today, and Wall Street opened down this morning after being closed on Wednesday in honor of former President George Bush.
