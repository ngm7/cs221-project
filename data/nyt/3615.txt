Still, the issues raised in the case — the widening use of national security concerns to justify trade barriers — were deemed important enough to warrant the appointment of the three-judge panel, the first time the court has assigned more than a single judge to a trade case since 2005.

“It would be the first time since the early New Deal era that courts ruled that Congress went too far in delegating its lawmaking powers,” Todd N. Tucker, a political scientist with the progressive Roosevelt Institute, wrote this year on the Lawfare website. “This is but the latest way that Trump’s aberrant behavior is prompting reactions that undermine longstanding norms.”

The trade law’s provision has been used previously — before Mr. Trump took office, there had been 26 investigations into whether imports pose a risk to American national security. In six of those cases, the president imposed a trade action, such as quotas, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But, according to Ms. Hogan, no president had used Section 232 to impose tariffs before Mr. Trump placed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum imports this past spring.

In June, the American Institute of International Steel, an association of companies that trade with the affected countries, filed a lawsuit attacking the law itself, after a legal challenge to Mr. Trump’s authority to use it was dismissed this year.

“We are challenging the law because no president before Trump ever used the law like this,” Mr. Morrison said. “The law has an opening, and he has taken advantage of it. There are no limits on what he can do.”

The judges in the case, all appointed by President Barack Obama, seemed to acknowledge the constraints placed on them by Supreme Court precedents, including the landmark 1976 case FEA v. Algonquin SNG Inc., which upheld the broad use of national security as a justification to impose quotas and licensing fees on imports.
