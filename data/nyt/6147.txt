SATURDAY PUZZLE — It is always such a pleasure to solve a Robyn Weintraub puzzle, but rarely do I get to do her commentary. This is only her second Saturday grid, and it’s possible that omniscient Deb times her vacations to maximize her Weintraub columns. (Speaking of, shout out to Deb for taking my last two weekends; she is a benevolent goddess.)

I freely confess that if I had to decide whether today’s solve would come on a Friday or a Saturday I’d be unable. But what does it really matter? Either way, this was a clean, silky smooth puzzle with enough misdirection to challenge me as I knocked the rust off my vacation pen (I had to edit my first four entries, thank you very much), and plenty of the very dry, but gentle, wit and subtle self-references that make Ms. Weintraub’s cluing so distinctive.

Tricky Clues

My hunch here, continuing in the Friday vs. Saturday vein, is that the same fill word that would be clearly clued at the beginning of the week gets a vaguer treatment on Friday, and a downright devious indicator the next day. My example here would be MEME, post-2010 (this entry was clued as “Same, in French,” or some variation thereof, going back to the ’50s). On a Monday, you might see “bit of viral web content”; on a Friday, “Repeatedly reposted item.” Today we had “One gets shared a lot,” which instantly struck me as “germ,” which was hard to shake off as the puzzle filled in.

I also had “river” incorrectly at the beginning of STEAMBOATS, “dog” for LOP, and “tase” for LASE, all in the early stages of solving, but everything eventually got sorted. The clues for ITEM, DJS, CLUE, EGG and others really sang; AVIATOR and GARBAGE BAG made me giggle.
