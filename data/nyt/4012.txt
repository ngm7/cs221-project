He declined to comment on the executive committee’s discussions about Dr. Fryer and whether the group had asked for his resignation. A spokesman for Dr. Fryer said he would not be issuing a statement.

Dr. Fryer, 41, has been one of the nation’s most celebrated young economists, and he is one of the highest-paid professors at Harvard. He won tenure at 30, the youngest African-American professor ever to do so at the university. In 2015 he received the John Bates Clark Medal, which honors an American under 40 for “a significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.”

His position could be in jeopardy as Harvard officials weigh the findings of several investigations into his conduct. An investigator has already substantiated seven distinct claims of instances in which Dr. Fryer subjected women to unwelcome sexual comments. At least one investigation into allegations of harassment and retaliation is continuing. The university is also investigating Dr. Fryer’s spending and the lab’s finances.

Dr. Fryer was already under investigation — and barred by Harvard from entering his lab — when the economic association nominated him for the executive committee, Dr. Blanchard said this fall. Members of the nominating commitee were unaware of the investigations, which Dr. Fryer did not disclose, Dr. Blanchard said. Some members learned of the allegations when The Harvard Crimson first reported on some of the investigations. But the group’s leadership never asked Dr. Fryer about the matter, Dr. Blanchard said.

This fall, Dr. Fryer was elected, but the vote caused a stir in the profession. Members of the executive committee posted a statement noting the allegations but saying they would wait for Harvard to conclude its investigations before considering how to respond.
