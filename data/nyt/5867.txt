Air travel can be a headache, especially during the holidays, but that didn’t stop one father from accompanying his youngest daughter on six flights in three days so she wouldn’t be alone during her first Christmas working as a flight attendant for Delta.

His journey so moved Mike Levy, a passenger on their flight from Fort Myers, Fla., to Detroit, that Mr. Levy wrote about the pair on Facebook in a post that has been shared more than 35,000 times.

“Now I’m seeing myself on my own Facebook feed,” Pierce Vaughan, 25, the flight attendant, said on Thursday from her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. “It’s very surreal.”

It wasn’t an easy journey for her father, Hal Vaughan, 65.

He was still healing from a broken neck after falling off a ladder while trimming tree limbs in June.
