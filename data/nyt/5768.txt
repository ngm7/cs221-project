Of course, the story was also Hollywoodized. That pivotal moment when Ruth freezes in court and cedes the floor to her husband? “There’s not a shred of truth to that,” her daughter said, a point the justice has also made. “I didn’t stumble,” she said in a recent Q. and A. after a screening in Manhattan, where the audience included Gloria Steinem and Hillary Clinton.

The mid-December event was held before Ginsburg had surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her lungs. But her health was still a fresh concern, since she broke three ribs last month. In a conversation with the NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg, she assured the crowd she was feeling “better each week” and was back to her regular, strenuous workouts with her trainer. “Even planks,” she said.

If she didn’t seek out the biopic, she seemed to appreciate it. “The film is part fact, part imaginative,” she said that night. “But what’s wonderful about it is that the imaginative parts fit in with the story so well.” (In lieu of interviews, Ginsburg participated in several Q. and A.s.)

Some of the legal groundwork may be familiar, thanks to the wildly popular documentary “RBG,” released in May. (Among her many firsts, Ginsburg is the only sitting Supreme Court justice to be the subject of two films in the same year.) But the revelation of the feature is in its focus on her home life: her terrible cooking, devoted mothering and spats with the teenage Jane, as well as the way in which Martin Ginsburg stepped up as parent and household co-leader.

Stiepleman viewed his uncle as an exemplary husband and father, a role model, and hoped to convey that onscreen. “It was that dynamic of two people my age, trying to figure out how to live at home what they’re also fighting for in court, which is true equality,” he said.
