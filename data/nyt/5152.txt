We would often wake on weekend mornings to find empty beer cans scattered across our front lawn. I would usually clean them up before my 5 a.m. shift at the local bakery on Saturday. But if it was Sunday, and I was sleeping in, my dad would pick them up. Christmas break was especially stressful because, with school closed, there was more time for vandalism.

Around Christmas 2006, eggs were thrown at our home. I remember climbing onto the roof through a front-facing window in my brother’s bedroom, balancing a bucket of scalding hot water to scrub the yolk off the shingles. It took hours, and I got frostbite. Our neighbors had eggnog; we had egg yolk.

I hated that this happened. But I mostly resented that my family was different, that I was not white and that my name was not John or Michael. On Christmas Eve, during my bakery shift, classmates would sometimes stop by on their way home from church for holiday pastries. Some were friendly. But I was too ashamed to embrace their holiday spirit.

One time, I came home so exhausted I couldn’t even make it up to my room. I slumped at the bottom of the stairs; my mom sat next to me. She didn’t ask what was wrong. Instead, she shared stories of her own experiences. Like when her colleagues looked askance at her when she began wearing her hijab at work. In her customary Egyptian folk wisdom, she said, in Arabic, “Irmee wara dahrak,” translated, “ Throw it behind your back. ” She also pointed out that bullying happens to many people for many reasons.

My mother’s words stayed with me, and over time helped me transform my pain into empathy. Whenever I go home, I run into those kids who used to torment me. We say hello awkwardly at a restaurant or the supermarket and catch up. My mind goes back to those painful school years, and I wonder if they remember, too.
