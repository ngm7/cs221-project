Amy Moy, a professor at New England College of Optometry, and her husband, Erick Moy, a research scientist, live in Winchester, Mass., with their 4-year-old daughter, Evie, who has Down syndrome. When she was born, she had three holes in her heart and was so tired that she struggled to eat.

“Early on when we found out, we thought about her health first, but then we worried, how will she be taken care of financially?” Mr. Moy said. “That caused us to have a lot of fear. The first thing was just understanding how the system works.”

Jaella Laplante worked as the director of a day program for adults with special needs, so when her daughter Declynn, now 3, was born with Prader-Willi syndrome, she knew to apply immediately to programs that offered early intervention.

Years later, she met other parents of children with the condition who had been paying out of pocket for years before they realized they could have had the state cover some of those bills. Costs for services that can help these children run into the six figures annually. Ms. Laplante said getting benefits early had helped keep her costs low.

Government benefits cover basic costs, but more affluent parents often want to supplement their child’s care. This can be tricky.

Parents need to buy life insurance early on to provide for children over their life expectancy. But any money given to a child with special needs could be taken by the government to cover its costs.

One way around this is to set up a special needs trust, which keeps the funds out of the government’s reach.
