To the Editor:

It is no surprise that President Trump is clueless about what’s happening in the stock market, because the blame falls directly on him and he never accepts responsibility. But recent reports in The Times (“Stocks Edge Closer to Bear Market as Trump and Mnuchin Fuel Drop,” news article, Dec. 25) indicate that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is similarly clueless.

Investor unease has nothing to do with the liquidity of banks or the underlying strength of the United States economy. Investors know that both are strong. Nor is the big problem the Fed’s increase in interest rates.

The big problem is Mr. Trump’s trade war. This has created huge uncertainty for investors as to the future strength not just of the American economy but also the world’s. Second, his erratic behavior and Twitter feeds compound investor uncertainty.

Given that no one has the ability to sit Mr. Trump down and explain the facts of life to him, this does not bode well for the future. The market’s only hope is that his mania for self-preservation will force the conclusion that he must end the trade war for the market to rebound.
