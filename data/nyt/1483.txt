ESTEVAN, Saskatchewan — Crews are hard at work these days on the oil rigs that rise above the horizon in southeastern Saskatchewan. At least for now.

Dylan Gilliss, the owner of a company that provides workers and equipment for drilling, sees plans by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to impose carbon taxes on the province as a threat to his business — and to those jobs — as well as a cash grab for the government.

“It’s going to come on the backs of the men, that’s who’s going to take the brunt of it,” Mr. Gilliss said while driving his white pickup truck along a gravel road lined with pump jacks.

“We’ll do layoffs or we’ll do wage cuts,” he said. “If none of that works, we’ll close the doors. That’s the sad and simple truth.”
