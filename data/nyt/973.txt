To the Editor:

I want to add an inside view to “Holiday Windows Still Matter” (Sunday Styles, Nov. 25).

As a professional sculptor working in the window display industry, I see these extravagant scenes surprise and delight everyone, including the many designers, artists and craftspeople who bring them to life.

Window display styles have advanced from traditional mechanized tableaux to interactive technological productions. As the retail landscape changes, these fleeting collaborations prevail as a vital art form in New York City.
