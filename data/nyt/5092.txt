Tyrann Mathieu hit the turf after failing to defend the pass, which left Agholor all by himself with 30 yards left to run. The wide receiver jogged the rest of the way for an 83-yard touchdown, taking the time to turn around and execute a picture-perfect trust fall into the end zone.

The Eagles stretched their lead to 13 points by taking advantage of a strip-sack fumble of Watson and marching down the short field before Foles found Zach Ertz for a 23-yard touchdown pass, only to have Elliott miss wide-right on his extra point attempt.

With the smallest of openings created by the missed extra-point, and a fumble by Philadelphia’s Josh Adams, Watson, who had guided the team to a 10-1 record after its 0-3 start, went to work. He led a pair of touchdown drives in which he repeatedly stepped out of sacks and somehow found receivers downfield, even after Demaryius Thomas was lost for the game, and most likely the season, with an injury to his Achilles’ tendon.

Watson’s connection with the rookie Vyncint Smith for a 35-yard touchdown pass gave Houston a lead with just over 2 minutes to play. But Foles, who had the wind knocked out of him on his team’s previous possession, took the Eagles 72 yards on 11 plays, setting Elliott up for the game-winning field goal.

J.J. Watt, Houston’s veteran star at defensive end, seemed to take the loss hard.

“I’ll put that on my shoulders,” Watt said. “The offense did a great job giving us a chance, and we just didn’t get a stop at the end.”

Foles looked just as electric as he did in last year’s postseason, completing 35 of 49 passes for 471 yards and four touchdowns. He had four receivers put up at least 75 yards, and he connected with Ertz 12 times, helping his teammate break Jason Witten’s N.F.L. record of 110 receptions in a season as a tight end. Ertz has 112 and counting.
