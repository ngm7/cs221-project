We asked, and you answered: What one theater production would you have put on your best of 2018 list that our chief theater critics, Ben Brantley and Jesse Green, left off theirs? You pointed us to Broadway and some tiny theaters beyond. You celebrated productions in cities far from New York. And from the sample you offered it seems like the Public Theater, in the East Village, had some especially satisfied customers. Here’s an edited sampling of your responses. SCOTT HELLER

[The best theater of 2018, according to our critics.]

On Broadway

I was fortunate enough to see my all-time favorite play, Tom Stoppard’s “Travesties,” in a magnificent revival by Roundabout Theater Company. (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and traveled to N.Y. to see it, and it was utterly worth it.) Tom Hollander was brilliant in the lead role of Henry Carr. SUE TROWBRIDGE

“The Lifespan of a Fact” was the best written and acted play I had seen in ages; the ensemble of Cherry Jones, Bobby Cannavale and Daniel Radcliffe was simply a gift from the acting gods. DENNIS NOLLETTE

With revivals and jukebox musicals filling Broadway, “The Prom” was a welcome original production, with a rare combination of clever dialogue, excellent dancing and a serious message. DAVID MACHLOWITZ
