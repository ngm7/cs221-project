SATURDAY PUZZLE — I had the opportunity to visit Machu Picchu two years ago, an amazing, must-see place, and en route ascended a peak that was about 12,000 feet above sea level. That was my first encounter with such a lofty altitude and it made me a little bit foggy-brained and panicky, which is also how I felt at certain points while trying to solve this puzzle by Trenton Charles and David Steinberg. There were dead ends and backtracks, but enough wit to make the effort worth it, and the summit was very satisfying.

Tricky Clues

There is no way these guys didn’t intentionally plant some of the misdirection in the grid today. I had, for example, “Lutz” for AXEL and “hit song” for HIPNESS; the cluing was perfect to send us down those paths.

The other thing that nailed me was weird repeated letters or letter combinations. I couldn’t figure out PG THIRTEEN for the life of me and didn’t think it was possible that OONA CHAPLIN could be in a new show (turns out she’s a granddaughter of Charlie and Oona O’Neill). THE EU was another stumper (especially crossed with PHU).

39A: I think I sounded hungry yesterday, and I am, because I’ve been on a DETOX DIET for this very reason — preparing to visit New Orleans and partake in the “deep-fried ball of cornmeal” that also goes by HUSH PUPPY, among other delicacies that could probably be described in similarly admonishing terms. This was a surprising debut today (as was COMIC SANS).
