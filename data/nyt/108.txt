In other remarks to reporters on the presidential plane, Mr. Trump said he would consider signing a two-week extension of government funding to give lawmakers more time to negotiate a seven-bill spending package, as well as to accommodate memorial services honoring former President George Bush, who died on Friday. Mr. Trump had told lawmakers he would veto any bill that did not include $5 billion for a southern border wall, raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown.

Mr. Trump also told reporters that his second summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, could be held in January or February, which he and his aides have suggested before.

The president’s Nafta move is the first indication of how he plans to deal with the new Democratic majority. Mr. Trump seems to have opted for diplomacy at the end of a political barrel, telling reporters on Saturday that Democrats “will have a choice” of whether to approve the deal as written or risk the consequences.

Even as he suggested he would make such a drastic move, he played down its potential impact, adding that he would have no problem reverting to a “pre-Nafta” environment. Such a scenario “works very well” for the United States, he said.

Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader who is likely to be elected speaker, cast doubt on the likelihood that the deal could be passed without significant new assurances from Mexico that labor standards in the agreement will be strictly enforced.
