More in hope than expectation, he took a couple of steps forward. Sead Kolasinac, for reasons best known to himself, tried to play a pass back to Leno. It made it only as far as Lingard, who needed a beat to realize quite what had happened, to process the nonsensical sequence of events that led him here, to the point where he was about to score a goal.

At no point did any Arsenal player consider tracking his run. At no point did anyone try and challenge him, until Leno had no choice. It was all very Arsenal.

More telling still, though, was what happened a few moments after Lingard’s goal. Arsenal poured forward, desperate to atone for the string of errors that had allowed United to draw level. The move broke down. Suddenly, Lingard had the ball in the middle of Arsenal’s half, with three teammates around him. Arsenal’s defense had evaporated, its fullbacks marooned upfield, their responsibilities forgotten in the excitement. United blew the chance, but still. It was all very Arsenal.

This is what always used to happen, of course: the lapses in concentration, the drifting into complacency, the lack of discipline, the shortage of tactical common sense. These were the shortcomings that pockmarked the last years of Arsène Wenger’s reign as Arsenal manager, when his team was always one defeat away from a crisis and rarely more than a set piece away from a defeat.
