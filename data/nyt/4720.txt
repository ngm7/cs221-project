Though Skye Curtin loves fairy tales, she knew her wedding to Austin McCormick would have no pixie dust or fancy details. She knew she wouldn’t be fussing over cake icing or place-card fonts. Ms. Curtin, who works four jobs and has a long commute to classes at the University of North Georgia, simply had no time, or money, for the little things.

“I absolutely was that little girl who wanted a perfect Cinderella wedding,” said Ms. Curtin, who is from Canton, Ga. “But when Austin proposed I knew we’d have to keep it modest. So our mind-set has been: We just want to get married.”

Even at their young age — Ms. Curtin is 20, Mr. McCormick, 22 — they have already completed a crash course in staying together in sickness and health, for richer or poorer.

Ms. Curtin and Mr. McCormick met in 2016 at a University of North Georgia church group meeting a few weeks into her freshman year. She couldn’t find a friend to go with, so she went alone and joined an acquaintance, Hunter Thompson, who had gone to high school with Mr. McCormick in Jasper, Ga. Mr. McCormick crossed the room to to say hello.
