UNITED NATIONS — They meet in the predawn darkness outside Central Park, less than two miles from the United Nations, where many of them often encounter one another, exchanging knowing glances or a runner-to-runner handshake.

Chugging through the dimly lit park on a 30-minute jog, they pass dog walkers, other runners and the occasional homeless person, stopping on a bridge midway through for a group photo and selfies.

You might mistake them for tourists.

But they are a group of ambassadors and other diplomats who call themselves the “PRunners” — named for the titles held by many as permanent representatives to the United Nations.

On a recent morning, they convened in a frigid pre-winter chill. Many wore white team shirts embossed with “PRunners” and the hashtag #NoExcuses. The range of other attire reflected their varying tolerances for the cold.
