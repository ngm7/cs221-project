I’ve been rapt for hours by yarns spun by those recovering from addiction — enough to fill memoirs, yet I must encapsulate them in 800 or so words. I’ve been shaken by many stories, among them: a woman who attempted suicide by self-immolation; a man struck by a car, which left him unable to work, depleted his savings and left him confined to his apartment; and a woman recovering from addiction whose infant son was murdered by her mother.

I’ve also seen firsthand how even small amounts of money yield a profound impact: A monthly MetroCard allows someone to get to a job-training course, kick-starting a steady source of income. A payment of rental arrears spares someone who fell behind as a result of medical bills from getting evicted. And there are countless stories that never get featured in the paper.

Yet, the project is unusual for The Times. The articles may be compelling and relevant, but they constitute a form of advocacy journalism: The stories are pitched to us and are written to engender donations. Each article, however, is held up to the same rigor and standards of veracity as any other in The Times.

My job, like that of any other journalist, is to report dutifully and honestly in a sensitive but forthright manner.

We are heartened that subjects are willing to open up about the painful parts of their past in the hopes that readers will be motivated to give to others who need a helping hand, and that others who are in need will seek out resources as well. Sometimes, subjects bristle at the name “Neediest Cases Fund,” which harks to the past.

However, the Fund has also moved forward in the last several years, including by adding an eighth beneficiary, the International Rescue Committee. Because of this, we are now telling stories beyond the city and looking at more global issues, just as The New York Times itself does.
