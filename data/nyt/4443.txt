That and the possibility that she is being drugged — “Say, what’s in this drink ?” — is what makes the song so offensive. There’s more here than that she wants to leave and he is trying to get her to stay and ain’t that adorable.

So now the old chestnut “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” is being targeted by some #MeToo enthusiasts. But if this song is offensive, what about “ L à ci darem la mano ,” the beautiful duet from Mozart’s “Don Giovanni”?

In the duet, the Don rather forcefully persuades Zerlina (who is in her wedding dress, about to be married to Masetto) to run off with him to his nearby villa. Will this have to go, too? And why not ban the entire opera? After all, its hero is a serial seducer and likely a rapist as well, whose servant Leporello tells us he has “seduced” 1,003 women in Spain alone. Sorry, Mozart; this kind of behavior is no longer acceptable.

I completely sympathize with the women who have been abused by the Weinsteins, Cosbys and O’Reillys of the world; I found Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony quite credible and Brett Kavanaugh’s subsequent tirade odious. But perhaps the #MeToo movement needs to step back for a moment and give more consideration to what it really wants to accomplish.

As the director of the Young Conservatory at American Conservatory Theater, for many years I used “Baby It’s Cold Outside” as a duet in our cabaret series with students in training. I always reversed the roles, with the woman pursuing the man, with him saying “I really can’t stay,” and the woman taking on the “But baby, it’s cold outside.” For our contemporary young female performers this proved such a better scenario. And our audiences always love the switch.
