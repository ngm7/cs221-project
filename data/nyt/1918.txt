The Brooklyn district attorney on Tuesday dropped charges against a mother whose son was torn from her arms as she was arrested in a Brooklyn government office last week, after an online video of the incident provoked widespread outrage.

The woman, Jazmine Headley, 23, was released from Rikers Island, where she has been held for five days, at 9 p.m. and was reunited with her baby boy a half-hour later, family members said. She still faces charges in a credit card fraud case from 2016 in Mercer County, N.J., where she must return to court on Wednesday.

Earlier in the day, Justice Craig S. Walker ordered Ms. Headley released during a hearing in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The judge said that the video of Ms. Headley’s arrest was a “horrific scene that was broadcast all over the United States.” He said that both Ms. Headley’s experience during her arrest and “the amount of time she has served” factored into his decision.

On Friday, Ms. Headley was sitting with her 1-year-old son, Damone, on the floor of an office in the Human Resources Administration building in Boerum Hill, where she had gone to try to get her child-care benefits reinstated. She had brought her son along because his day care center had informed her the city was no longer paying his fee, her lawyer and a family member said.
