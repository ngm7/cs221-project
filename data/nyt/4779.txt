What’s on TV

ISLE OF DOGS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO. Wes Anderson’s latest stop-motion animation opens with a cat-loving mayor (voiced by Kunichi Nomura) of a dystopian Japanese city banishing all dogs to a garbage dump called Trash Island. In hopes of saving his pet (Liev Schreiber), the mayor’s ward, Atari (Koyu Rankin), travels to the isle and seeks the help of abandoned dogs who answer to a stray voiced by Bryan Cranston. In line with Anderson’s touch, the film features stunning visuals, symmetrical frames and a star-studded cast that includes Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum. But it has raised eyebrows over its presentation of Japanese culture and omission of subtitles. The main treat here is the title characters: “The dogs provide the emotion in this movie,” the film critic Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “They’re surprising, touching and thoroughly delightful company distinguished by witty vocalizations, expressive eccentricities and too many heartbreaking markers of abuse.”
