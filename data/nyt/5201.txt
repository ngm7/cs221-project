Re “New Google Campus Accelerates Tech’s March Into New York” (front page, Dec. 18):

Reading that Google is building a billion -dollar campus in Chelsea hit me like a recurring nightmare. After 30 years in San Francisco, I recently moved to Manhattan to escape the cultural destruction Big Tech companies like Google inflicted on that once-great city.

Google et al. are economic bullies who bring gentrification and cultural blandification. New York City will certainly regret this in the long run. Take it from someone who has seen this already.

To the Editor:

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if just a few of the incoming engineering geniuses were assigned to work on the improvement of our city — the horrific traffic for starters, including public transit; poorly maintained lower- and middle-income residential buildings; the environment, including noise; the schools. Each of us can make up his or her own list.

Maybe a few of our local real estate people, along with the politicians, could be persuaded to help instead of hinder. This invasion could be a marvelous pilgrimage. As we head into a new year, it is time for high hopes and dreaming.
