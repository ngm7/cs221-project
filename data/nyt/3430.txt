The people have spoken. The HOLLAAD TONNEL is no more.

For decades, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has spruced up the sign above the Holland Tunnel’s New Jersey entrance with holiday decorations: a Christmas tree and two wreaths.

And for years, their placement over the letters of the tunnel’s name has driven some commuters crazy — particularly the location of the tree, which is nestled in the N of “Holland” instead of in the adjacent A that the tree more closely resembles.

Now, after an online poll prompted by a viral petition that urged the Port Authority to re-deck the Holland, the tree will move. It will be shifted off the N and moved to a new home next door, over the A, the Port Authority announced on Monday.
