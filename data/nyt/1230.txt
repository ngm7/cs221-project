Starting early next year, the Economic Security Project, a private foundation, will pay a select group of residents in Stockton $500 a month for 18 months, with no strings attached. It is part of an experiment to determine how people use money, Mr. Tubbs said.

“I started out as a skeptic,” he said. “But now I’m 100 percent resolved. Folks need an economic floor, at least to build on.” Katy Reckdahl

What if Kaepernick Was in the N.B.A.?

The N.B.A. has earned a term that its commissioner hadn’t heard. “How does it feel to be the wokest professional sports league?” asked Marc Lacey, the national editor at The Times.

“I didn’t know we were given that designation,” said Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, laughing. “But I understand the sentiment and we’re proud of that.”

In the past few years, the N.B.A. has found itself in the spotlight for the way its players and teams have spoken out on social and political issues. They are in stark contrast to the N.F.L., which has struggled to handle the reaction to its players kneeling during the national anthem.

Which begs the question. Where would Colin Kaepernick be if he were an N.B.A. player?

Mr. Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Superbowl in 2012, has remained unsigned since the end of the 2016 season, when he took a knee during the national anthem to raise awareness of racism, social injustice and police brutality.

That wouldn’t be the case in the N.B.A., said Grant Hill, the co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks, who was also on the panel. “I believe if there was a Colin Kaepernick in the N.B.A., he’d be playing. I’ve talked to our managing partner about this plenty of times; we would be supportive of any of our athletes and their willingness to engage, to speak out on various issues.”
