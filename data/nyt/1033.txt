To the Editor:

In “Prisoners Need a New Set of Rights” (Op-Ed essay and video, nytimes.com, Nov. 26), Meek Mill shines a light on the dark reality of our criminal legal system. In doing so, he lists overburdened public defenders as part of the problem.

While indigent defense is chronically underfunded, hard-working public defenders stand shoulder to shoulder with their clients every day in the fight for justice. Rather than see defenders as contributing to a system of racism and oppression, we should look to defenders as a critical part of the new future Mr. Mill calls on us to build.

In a just-released study, the Bronx Defenders’ model of representation, called holistic defense, was found to reduce pretrial detention by 9 percent, incarceration rates by 16 percent and incarceration length by 24 percent .

Over a 10-year period, representation by the Bronx Defenders saved our clients 1.1 million days in jail. The study shows that public defenders are a powerful weapon in the fight against mass incarceration. If we work together, we will be able to deliver the new set of rights that Mr. Mill calls for.
