No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.

This Weekend I Have … an Hour, and I’m Festive

‘RuPaul’s Drag Race Holi-slay Spectacular’

When to watch: Friday at 8 p.m., on VH1.

We need more holiday specials, and we especially need more from reality contest shows, like this one-off from “Drag Race” — essentially an all-star episode that condenses the premise of the show into one wintry bonanza. “Top Chef” should do this, “Project Runway” should do this, and “Ink Master,” “Top Model,” “So You Think You Can Dance,” “Dancing With the Stars,” “The Amazing Race” and most especially “Making It” should all do this next year and every year hence.
