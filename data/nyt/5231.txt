Wanting to do more, Mr. Costello began spearheading a toy drive of his own, transforming a holiday party he throws every year into a more philanthropic event, with Catholic Charities as the beneficiary. He rents a hall to serve as a party space; the cost of admission is a toy or a game to be donated. The toys collected on Dec. 8 this year were distributed at a Brooklyn parish on Wednesday and at a church in Astoria on Thursday.

“This can make a kid’s Christmas no matter what,” said Mr. Costello, 66. After leading the project for more decades, he said he needs the dozen or so volunteers who make the event possible now more than ever. “We have to keep going,” he said.

The toy collection event this year was held at Our Lady of Lourdes in Queens Village; the basement auditorium can hold the 400 to 500 attendees. Budweiser donated beer, as it has done for more than 15 years. Some people donate money to Catholic Charities to help offset costs, and restaurants and business offer raffle prizes.

“If you can bring a smile to a kid’s face, that’s the main thing,” Mr. Costello said. “I can’t picture a kid waking up on Christmas Day without a gift.”

Bringing Help to Families in Need

Children’s Aid

Beaming children were the inspiration for another holiday event held last week at the Children’s Aid Frederick Douglass Community Center, the site of the Garden of Dreams’ Adopt-a-Family holiday gift distribution. The Garden of Dreams Foundation is a nonprofit organization that works to help children facing obstacles.
