BRUSSELS — Belgium’s prime minister, under pressure from the right and left, submitted his resignation Tuesday in the face of a populist revolt over his migration policy, which opponents say threatens Belgian sovereignty.

Prime Minister Charles Michel’s problems echo those of other European leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, who are trying to maintain centrist governments in the face of opposition from both flanks.

Right-wing allies of Mr. Michel’s center-right government abandoned him earlier this month, angry over his migration policy which had Belgium join a United Nations accord that agrees to share the burdens of immigration. Left-wing opponents, meanwhile, demanded more ambitious environmental policies, lower taxes and more affordable prescription drugs.

Mr. Michel made an impassioned, last-gasp speech to Parliament and asked his left-wing opponents to forge a new alliance that would keep him in office.
