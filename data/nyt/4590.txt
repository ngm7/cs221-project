Re “U.S. Ends Mission in Syria as Trump Pulls 2,000 Troops” (front page, Dec. 20):

Although the extrication of our soldiers from Syria is a laudable goal supported by most Americans , there is every reason to believe that the president’s action to pull our troops out of that country now is ill advised. It is ominous that the pullout is being heralded by mischief-making nations like Russia.

President Trump seeks to justify this action as something that is warranted because of the vanquishing of ISIS in Syria. His declaration of victory over the terrorist organization may well prove to be every bit as credible as his ludicrous assertion that through one meeting with North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, the threat of nuclear conflict had vanished.

Mr. Trump has told us that he receives his intelligence from shows like “Fox and Friends” and, in an insult to the top brass of the military, that he knows more than the generals.

It is striking that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, elected to go through the revolving door of administration officials, clearly stating his disagreement with the president on the Syria withdrawal as he tendered his resignation on Thursday, departing with honor.
