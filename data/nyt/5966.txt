Vietnamese coffee is one exception to my usual practice of not sweetening my coffee (the other is Turkish or Greek). In Vietnam, the typically dark pour-over brew is mellowed with sweetened condensed milk. Now Copper Cow Coffee — a California company started by Debbie Wei Mullin, who went back to Saigon, her mother’s hometown, to research the coffee — has introduced a handy kit for making it. Disposable pour-over filters and convenient single-portion packets of sweetened condensed milk are all you need. The company makes a kit for Thai iced tea with sweetened condensed milk, too, and sells the milk packets separately.

Vietnamese coffee kit, $15 for five servings; Thai iced tea kit, $14 for five servings; creamer, $6 for eight packets, coppercowcoffee.com.
