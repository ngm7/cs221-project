Bring Drama to Your Mantel

Nothing makes a festive statement like a fireplace filled with seasonal flora and fauna. Kitten Grayson Flowers, the London studio known for its striking configurations of wild and sustainable blooms, recommends approaching your display as if building a set. Following the advice of Kitten Grayson, the studio’s founder, and Harriette Tebbutt, its creative director, you’ll need to invest in a premade garland (from any good garden center) as a base, chicken wire to tie everything together and some standard stage weights to tether the arrangement to the mantelpiece or mirror. Grayson advises sticking to three or four natural ingredients. Gather dried berries and pine cones or mimosa, helichrysum or berried eucalyptus.

“Don’t be sparing,” says Grayson, who is also the floral consultant to the Heckfield Place hotel. “You want to go big. It should be natural — but fun.” She suggests working in one ingredient at a time, using differing lengths of foliage at the front and back of the garland to create a sense of body and height. For a festive installation at the London antiques dealer Jamb, Grayson festooned her display with a cerise marigold garland made from recycled Indian plastic. Dried hydrangeas spray-painted gold or citrus fruits and pink peppercorns lend extra color and pizazz.
