Here’s an hors d’oeuvre to add to the repertory just as the demand to entertain ramps up: pigs in a blanket. Christian Leue — the manager of La Boîte, a spice shop in Hell’s Kitchen — has developed an effective recipe for quick and versatile puff pastry that’s perfect for the wrapped bites.

Use the shredding disc in a food processor to grate a frozen stick of salted butter. Switch to the regular blade, add three-quarters of a cup flour and pulse until crumbly. Add a quarter cup sour cream and pulse until a dough forms. Knead lightly and shape into a flattened square. Refrigerate at least two hours. Sear 24 cocktail franks in a skillet, drain on paper towels and let cool. Roll the dough into a 9-by-12 inch rectangle and cut in 24 pieces, each 3-by-1 1/2 inches. Place a frank across the dough strip and wrap it. Moisten the short edge of the dough with water, press closed and place on a baking sheet seam side down. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. Makes 24 and can be doubled or tripled.
