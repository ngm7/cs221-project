It’s been a memorable year in the art world, not for what happened, but for who left.

On Monday, Christie’s announced that Loic Gouzer, its innovative co-chairman of postwar and contemporary art in New York, would be leaving the auction house by the end of the year. Mr. Gouzer said in a statement that he intended to spend the next few months “concentrating on conservation and climate issues before coming back to the art world with a new project.”

Mr. Gouzer is the third prominent auction house executive whose departure has been announced recently. On Nov. 21, Christie’s said that Francis Outred, its head of postwar and contemporary art in Europe, would be leaving. On Dec. 3, Sotheby’s said that Adam Chinn, its chief operating officer, would also be stepping down, with his role eliminated.

Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive of Christie’s, said in an email to The New York Times that the auction house would “primarily count on our existing teams in Europe and in New York” to replace Mr. Gouzer and Mr. Outred. “I strongly believe the real stars are the brand and the team,” Mr. Cerutti added.

Mr. Gouzer’s leaving Christie’s represented the biggest shock, given that he was the architect of the mold-breaking $705.9 million “Looking Forward to the Past” auction of 20th-century art in 2015, as well as the inclusion of a $450.3 million Leonardo da Vinci in a contemporary art sale in New York in 2017. But the abrupt departure of three such senior figures reflects the intense competitive pressure that deal-makers are under at the top end of the auction market.
