The standard of care for feral cats is known as trap-neuter-return (TNR), which entails humanely trapping the cat, sterilizing it, and returning it to where it was found. But sometimes the cats can’t be returned to where they lived before, either because their caretaker is no longer there to provide food and water, or because their environment has been made cat-unfriendly. They need a place to go.

Animal rescue groups have created working-cat programs wherein homeowners or store owners agree to provide the cats with shelter, food, water and medical care — promising to take care of it like any other pet — in exchange for an added line of defense against vermin.

“Even though there’s absolutely no guarantee they will get any and all rodents, it often works out that way. The cat gets a home and the business or owner gets reduced or no rodents,” said Jesse Oldham, a community cat expert for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), based in New York City. “We’ve also seen a lot of people also just like cats. It’s nice having them around, even if they’re not particularly social.”

Working cats in businesses have become a familiar concept. Bodega cats, for example, have attained internet cult status and large Instagram followings. The cats of Disneyland have their own Instagram account too (hopefully taking care of mice but not that mouse). But working cats, which in more rural settings have long been known as barn cats, can have a place in residential areas as well. Mr. Stoike has a garage where he keeps his working cat. A basement or shed will also suffice.
