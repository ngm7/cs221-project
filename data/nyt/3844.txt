Liverpool vs. Bayern Munich and Manchester United vs. Paris St. Germain are two of the more enticing matchups in the round of 16 of the Champions League, which was drawn on Monday.

Manchester United is in disarray, standing only sixth in the Premier League and coming off a loss to Liverpool. It will face a daunting task against P.S.G., unbeaten and already 10 points clear in the French league, which it has dominated in recent years. But the prize P.S.G. most covets, the Champions League, has so far eluded it. This will be the first European meeting between the teams.

The attacking trio of Kylian Mbapp√©, Neymar and Edinson Cavani will be particularly imposing against a Manchester United defense that has surrendered 29 goals in 17 games, the fifth highest total in the Premier League.

Liverpool is in first place in the Premier League and looking like a strong contender for its first title since 1990. It faces a major obstacle in Bayern, though that team is unexpectedly back in third place in the Bundesliga, which it has won six times in a row.
