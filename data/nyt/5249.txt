CURATORS’ CHOICE 2018 at the Museum of the Moving Image (Dec. 28-Jan. 6). Aiming to highlight the variety and innovation of the movies released over the past 12 months, this annual series opens on Friday with “Minding the Gap,” one of the four documentaries chosen by A. O. Scott in a tie for the best film of 2018. (Two of the others, “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” and “Bisbee ’17,” will screen on Jan. 6.) Among the most original titles is Valeska Grisebach’s “Western” (on Sunday), a fiction feature about German interlopers working in a far-flung section of Bulgaria, an area they are ostensibly helping to modernize. The movie flirts with the conventions of the western genre to reflect on the economic and cultural rifts of contemporary Europe.
