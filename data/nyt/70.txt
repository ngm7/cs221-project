ANCHORAGE — The magnitude 7 earthquake that jolted Anchorage on Friday cracked buildings, damaged roads and buckled bridges, drawing swift comparisons to a temblor in 1964 that devastated the region and remains a dominant part of Alaskan history.

But on Saturday, even amid hundreds of aftershocks, residents of this port city marveled that the damage had not been much worse. The Anchorage Fire Department responded to four structure fires as a result of the quake, according to City Hall, and two reports of structure collapse are being investigated. No deaths have been reported.

It could have turned out very differently, and many thought it would.

Experts said that while the quake was significantly less intense than the one in 1964, which was magnitude 9.2, its limited destruction was the result of the region’s growing smarter and much more resilient in the years since. Anchorage was much better prepared for a major earthquake; other cities may not have fared so well.

The 1964 quake and the tsunami that followed killed more than 100 people, destroyed scores of homes and wiped out several small towns along the coast. It is the most powerful seismic event in the country’s history and the second-most powerful recorded globally.
