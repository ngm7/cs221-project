While we’re tracking the turmoil around the British Parliament’s vote on Brexit, we enlisted Ellen Barry, our London-based chief international correspondent, to take over the top of your daily briefing. Let us know what you think.

Good morning.

This was expected to be a week of fireworks in British politics, as Parliament was finally getting a chance to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, and Monday morning was spent in a jittery countdown.

“Right everyone, this may be the most exciting week of Brexit,” the legal commentator David Allen Green wrote on Twitter as the hour closed in. “Brace, brace.”

I had already left for lunch when it emerged, via multiple unattributed leaks, that Mrs. May had decided at the last minute to indefinitely postpone the vote rather than face what promised to be a humiliating defeat. The news so jolted the machinery of Westminster that one of the BBC’s political commentators lapsed into total honesty.
