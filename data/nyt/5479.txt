CLEMSON, S.C. — Seven microphones awaited Christian Wilkins, Clemson’s three-time All-American defensive lineman, at a recent news conference involving him and his fellow defensive starters. Most of the other players had just one microphone mounted in front of their seats.

When Wilkins arrived, he mischievously switched his name card with the other one at his table, prompting the news media to play along, repositioning themselves and their equipment to lob questions at Clemson’s most popular player.

It made for good copy, at least: Christian being Christian — not so different from when he did a playful split onto a field of confetti after Clemson won the national title nearly two years ago.

Wilkins’s celebrity stems primarily from his remarkable talent and versatility. Listed at 6 feet 4 inches tall and 315 pounds, he is agile enough to line up at running back and in punt protection. A likely first-round pick in the N.F.L. draft next spring, Wilkins is a chief reason that No. 2 Clemson (13-0) has the country’s fourth-ranked defense and that the Tigers are favored in their national semifinal playoff vs. No. 3 Notre Dame (12-0) on Saturday in Arlington, Tex.
