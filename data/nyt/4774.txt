The Merry X-Men Holiday Special (Marvel Entertainment), an anthology from Marvel Comics with 22 stories (most of them a single page each), presents the first 25 days of December in the lives of the X-Men and X-Women: Jubilee plans a Hawaiian vacation with her son, Shogo, and is thwarted by a villain; a little girl plays with Deadpool and Jean Grey action figures; and Beast tries to find the perfect “Star Wars” gift for his love interest. Two somber pages, in particular, resonate: Those of Dec. 2 and Dec. 9.

Kitty Pryde lights a menorah on Dec. 2 and remembers her father and 12 million others who were massacred by anti-mutant forces in Genosha, an island nation that was supposed to be a haven for mutants. “Their lives, their dreams, their futures, were stolen from them by hate,” she thinks.
