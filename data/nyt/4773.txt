SATURDAY PUZZLE — There are some really nice entries in Joon Pahk’s puzzle, but I honed in on 16A’s ADULTING for two reasons: First, it’s a fairly modern term in a puzzle with a good amount of entries about things that go back in time; and second, it’s a topic that is discussed on the regular in my household.

As the mother of young adult children, I happen to be a big fan of ADULTING, because it means that my kids are learning the key life skills they need to stride confidently into the world and take it by storm. It also means that I don’t have to do absolutely everything for them anymore (see also: “It’s my time now.”).

Maybe — like other generations before mine — I’m misremembering, but when I was growing up, my peers and I couldn’t wait to be adults, independent of our parents. We excitedly put on the mantle of adulthood with dignity and with relish — transitioning seamlessly from the halcyon days of childhood — no matter how long it took us to pass that calculus class and finally graduate from college. In my case, the answer was three times, but as I said, we were excited and the transition was seamless. Mostly.

And yet, when uttered by today’s young adults, the word ADULTING is usually accompanied by a shudder. Even a successful attempt at taking on a new responsibility is met with their own disbelief that they can cope with adulthood. “OMG,” they like to say on the Twitter machine, “I can’t believe I’m ADULTING.”
