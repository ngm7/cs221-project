Irwin Hollander, an artist and a master printer who persuaded Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell and other Abstract Expressionist painters to try their hands at lithography in his East Village workshop, died on Nov. 16 in Brooklyn. He was 90.

His death was confirmed by his son Mark, who said Mr. Hollander had suffered a stroke several years ago and had continuing heart problems.

Starting out as a hopeful young artist who became a commercial lithographer to survive, Mr. Hollander was part of the revival of fine art printing and especially lithography that took hold in the United States around 1960. He often said that his main goal was “to serve artists.”

He was best known for convincing de Kooning and Motherwell, who had never been deeply involved with printmaking, that their gestural, improvisational styles would adapt well to lithography, perhaps the most forgiving of print mediums. In both cases the results were celebrated; in fact, several of the de Kooning lithographs that Mr. Hollander published in 1971 were first exhibited that year in their own show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
