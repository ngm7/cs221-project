Here’s a plump, rich chocolate chip cookie with a difference: Tahini replaces the eggs, and extra-virgin olive oil stands in for butter. The result is an irresistible vegan confection. It’s made and sold at Seven Grams Caffe coffee shops and bakeries and online.

Chocolate Chip Cookies, $4 in the cafes, 275 Seventh Avenue (26th Street), 76 Madison Avenue (28th Street), 175 Varick Street (Charlton Street); $65 for 12 in a box including nationwide shipping, sevengramscaffe.com.
