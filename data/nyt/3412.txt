What’s on TV

PETE HOLMES: DIRTY CLEAN (2018) 10 p.m. on HBO. Fans waiting for the return of the series “Crashing” in January can watch Pete Holmes be his goofy self — as opposed to a dramatized version of it — in this new stand-up special. Here he riffs on parenting, pokes fun at Elon Musk and shares his vision of the afterlife. In addition to starring in “Crashing,” which is loosely based on Holmes’s life, the comic draws cartoons and hosts a podcast called “You Made It Weird.” His first HBO stand-up special, “FACES AND SOUNDS,” is available to stream on the network’s digital platforms.

DANNEMORA PRISON BREAK 7 p.m. on Oxygen. This two-hour special looks back at an escape from prison that captivated the United States when, in June 2015, two inmates at a correctional facility in Dannemora, N.Y., escaped with the help of a prison seamstress. The sensational events grew even more tantalizing as the police carried out a 23-day manhunt. The case inspired the Showtime mini-series “ESCAPE AT DANNEMORA,” which stars Benicio Del Toro, Paul Dano and Patricia Arquette.

THE ALEC BALDWIN SHOW 10 p.m. on ABC. Alec Baldwin sits down with Kerry Washington, who currently stars in “American Son” on Broadway, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
