PARIS — The fifth weekend of “Yellow Vest” protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s economic and social policies drew far fewer demonstrators on Saturday, but thousands still filled the streets of Paris and other French cities in defiance of government security warnings and despite bitter cold.

The demonstrations were also calmer than in past weeks — though some scuffles broke out between protesters and the police, who fired tear gas and water cannons several times to disperse crowds.

The ranks of protesters dwindled after Mr. Macron this week promised tax cuts and wage increases to mollify the Yellow Vests, who are angry over the cost of living and high taxes. It was still not clear whether Mr. Macron was able to convince many of the protesters, as he struggles to address an unstructured and leaderless movement with myriad grievances.
