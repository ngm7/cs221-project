• A trade war truce, at least in the short term.

Over steaks at the G-20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and President Xi Jinping, pictured above, agreed on compromises that will pause their escalating economic conflict.

Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on a major increase in tariffs on Chinese goods planned for Jan. 1. Mr. Xi agreed to increase Chinese purchases of American goods.

But the handshake deal was “less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted,” writes our White House correspondent. The two world leaders set an ambitious 90-day timeline to reach broader trade agreements, but they remain deeply divided.
