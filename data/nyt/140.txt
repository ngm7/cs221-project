Hello! Welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture.

Gritty, the Twitter darling and mascot for the Philadelphia Flyers, is now a cover star. He graces Artforum’s “year in review” issue, and in an accompanying essay the magazine’s deputy editor writes that “Gritty is definitely a fitting mascot for the year, a realistic representation.” While this may not be Time’s Person of the Year (which he nominated himself for on Twitter), I hope it does mean Gritty’s social-media team gets a big holiday bonus.
