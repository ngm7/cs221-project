At the Knicks’ practice facility in Tarrytown, N.Y., earlier this week, there were good fouls, bad fouls and push-ups. It all had to do with the rookie center Mitchell Robinson, whose defense in the first two months of his N.B.A. career has ranged from dazzling, as in nine blocks against Orlando, to disastrous, as in six fouls in nine minutes against New Orleans.

So Knicks Coach David Fizdale made a deal with Robinson. “If he doesn’t do the foul where his hands are down, I got to do push-ups,” Fizdale said. “And if he does, then he has to do push-ups. So you might see my body change here. I’m about to get in shape, man. I hope I’m doing push-ups. Trust me, I hope.”

The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of the June draft with the 36th pick over all. He was the only player in this year’s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft.

Considered a top recruit coming out of Chalmette High School in Louisiana, Robinson committed to Western Kentucky, left campus before the season started, considered other colleges and then returned briefly to the Hilltoppers before finally deciding to skip college altogether. By that point, playing overseas or in the G League wasn’t an option.
