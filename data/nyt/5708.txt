What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?

“Jesse James,” by T. J. Stiles, and a King James Bible from which I have been stealing material for almost six decades.

Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer?

I think Charles Willeford’s “I Was Looking for a Street” is one of the best books ever written about the Great Depression. He was a fine writer as well as a fine man. At the Battle of Arnhem he took his tank behind German lines and piled 23 grunts on it, and took them home. He received the Silver Star and the Croix de Guerre, and refused to talk about any of it.

What kind of reader were you as a child?

I loved the bookmobile. My favorite books were the Hardy Boys. When I was growing up, people did not have a lot of discretionary income, and on Thursday afternoons the arrival of the bookmobile on our dead-end street sent kids running down to the cul-de-sac to be first in line for Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. In many ways it was a grand time to be around.

Favorite childhood literary character or hero?

The Hardy Boys. Can I sneak comics in here? Captain Marvel was unbeatable.

What’s the last book you recommended to a member of your family?

The most recent book written by our daughter Alafair. She was reading “Cool Hand Luke,” by Donn Pearce, when she was 5 years old. She wrote her first short stories in the first grade. One was titled “The Roller Rink Murder Case.” She’s been at it unrelentingly ever since.

What’s the best book you ever received as a gift?

“Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare,” by Stephen Greenblatt.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

“New Hope for the Dead,” by Charles Willeford. Charles used to call it his “ultimate self-help book.”
