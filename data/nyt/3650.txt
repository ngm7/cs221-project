A Restored House in Baden-Baden

$6.2 MILLION (5.5 MILLION EUROS)

This three-story home is a short walk from the center of Baden-Baden, the spa town in the mountainous Black Forest region of southwestern Germany. Known as Villa Thur, the 4,628-square-foot house is on Lichtentaler Allee, a historic corridor of parks, gardens and old homes along the River Oos.

The four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house was built in 1877, making it one of the oldest homes in the area. It has been designated a historic landmark, so the exterior and elements of the interior cannot be altered without approval, said Andreas Klein, an agent with Engel & Volkers, which has the listing.

A complete restoration of the half-acre property, in the 1990s, took more than four years to complete, Mr. Klein said. The project was conducted with “the close cooperation of the local government,” he said, to ensure preservation of the historic elements.

During the restoration, an elevator was installed and modern water, electricity and heating systems were added. Repairs were made to the facade and roof, and a two-car garage was built. “A lot of money was also invested in the outdoor area,” Mr. Klein said, “to build a new terrace and rebuild the garden in a historical way.”
