There are plenty of dystopias to give us nightmares, but a world without a utopia may be a world not worth living in; utopia is to our notion of history as the speed of light is to the cosmos. It forms the horizon of possibilities necessary for orientation to the world. Without an imaginative search for a better society we are bound to flounder in confused expediency.

Because the ideologies of the past century have been largely discredited as false utopias, we are bereft of the notion of a better future. Whether the idea of a utopia ever returns will depend on our spirit, our faith in what is to come. Yet who are we to make demands of the spirit, which will wander as it will?

Remember remembering? Remember how we use to learn things by heart? Whole poems we could recite, the phone numbers of all our friends and our relatives besides? Remember how we used to have to remember directions to a place, including interesting detours we could take that had started out as a mistake? We had to remember what we needed, because we couldn’t just call home if we forgot. Remember when we had to remember what people looked like without looking them up, when we couldn’t consign the most important things in life to someone else’s hard drive?

Remember how we committed the important things to memory, where they were locked up for life? Everything inside us, without strings attached? Remember, oh, remember, the small, shy animal that would come out of the thicket of thinking when we sat quietly by, without a thing to do in this world, nothing pinging or vibrating or alerting us otherwise? And we would muse and mull over things. Remember musing?
