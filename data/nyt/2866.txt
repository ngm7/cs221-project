Q. Why do albino animals have red eyes?

A. Eyes are not actually red or pink in animals with albinism. Instead, both the iris and the tissue coating the retina contain very little coloration, and the absence or shortage of pigment in the eye may expose underlying blood vessels.

In humans, a condition called oculocutaneous albinism reduces pigmentation of skin, hair and eyes. The condition, which results from genetic anomalies that block or limit an enzyme needed to produce the pigment melanin, is linked to several vision flaws and sensitivity to light.

Most humans with albinism have some color in their eyes â€” usually blue, but sometimes hazel or brown. Another form of albinism, called ocular albinism, is less common and affects only the eyes.

Albino animals include the familiar white rabbit. Although there are albino cats, the blue-eyed Siamese is not a true albino; its fur gains color under the proper temperature conditions.
