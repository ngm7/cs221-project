Lamentations

To the Editor:

In his review of five new books on Judaism (“Lamentations,” Nov. 18), Gal Beckerman movingly described the plight of contemporary American Judaism, with its spiritual void, sky-high intermarriage rate and lack of reverence on the part of most Jews. Yet I wish he had discussed the very different experiences of Orthodox Jews, for whom Judaism is often a living, dynamic and profoundly challenging and elevating experience. Instead, he dismisses Orthodox Judaism as something exotic and closed, and chooses to concentrate on “the 90 percent who are not Orthodox.” This diminishes his otherwise excellent essay.

To a member of that Orthodox 10 percent, his choice is jarring. For one thing, Orthodoxy is growing rapidly. Fifteen percent of American Jews aged 28 to 45 identify as Orthodox and 27 percent of American Jewish children are being raised in Orthodox homes. Orthodox Jews are following a dynamic and relevant religion. I wish Beckerman had included us in his conversation.

To the Editor:

Gal Beckerman’s quest for meaning in Judaism takes him everywhere except in the direction of Judaism itself. Lamenting the emptiness in the liberal Jewish world and the growth of assimilation, he sets us on a path to nowhere with his suggestions for books that only reinforce that idea. In fact, Jewish life today is far more nuanced. The historically neat boundaries of denominationalism are fraying. Today Jews search in many directions, and more and more are dabbling with traditional Judaism.
