An intimately staged and darkly revisionist revival of “Oklahoma!” that enjoyed a critically acclaimed and sold-out Off Broadway run will transfer to Broadway this season.

The production, which originated in 2015 at Bard College’s SummerScape festival and then was staged this fall at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, will begin previews on March 19 and open on April 7 at Circle in the Square, which is the only theater-in-the-round on Broadway.

Set in Indian Territory in the early 20th century, just before Oklahoma became a state, the influential Rodgers and Hammerstein musical depicts a love triangle unfolding against the backdrop of a transforming nation.

The new production, at once joyful and menacing, is directed by the experimental theater veteran Daniel Fish and features countrified arrangements of the classic score performed by a small onstage band.
