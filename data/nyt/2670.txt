‘Only a few months back, Pongo Twistleton began speaking in tongues after being obliged to ingest a half-pint beaker filled with mustard, Tabasco, Patum Peperium, and an intensely venomous bloater paste.’

— From “Jeeves and the King of Clubs” (Little, Brown & Company, 2018, Page 9), an homage to the classic P.G. Wodehouse characters by the author Ben Schott.

As Buster Keaton is to silent film, as Basho is to haiku, as Missy Elliott is to intergalactic sonic cosmography, P.G. Wodehouse is to the English comic novel. He maxed out every dial on the dashboard. To read a single Wodehouse sentence is to enter an alternate universe: a zero-gravity caperscape of aristocratic bumbling that seems to transcend time.

Wodehouse, unfortunately, could not transcend time; he died in 1975. Since then, his oeuvre has stubbornly refused to expand. To remedy this, and with the blessing of the Wodehouse estate, the contemporary writer Ben Schott has produced a novel-length homage: a nearly 300-page impression of the master. It is an audaciously risky parlor trick, like going to Monet’s pond, whipping out an iPad and trying to paint the water lilies.

Schott pulls the trick off improbably well. He reproduces the Wodehouse voice with fetishistic accuracy: the casual abbreviations (“the milk of h.k.”) and florid similes (“Florence tilted her head, like a cat puzzling a human meow”) and creative idioms (a nap is referred to as “checking the eyelids for holes”). He piles up heaps of ridiculous names: Bingo Little, Tuppy Glossop, Freddie Bullivant, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright. And his dialogue is perfectly inane. “What’s the thing to thing, Jeeves, that’s thinged with those thingummies?” the narrator asks at one point — to which the omniscient Jeeves responds, of course, that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
