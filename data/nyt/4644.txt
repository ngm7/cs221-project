People know you for starring in “Moonlight” in 2016, but before you became an actor, you were on your way to becoming a track-and-field star until you suffered an injury. What’s harder: running with a torn A.C.L. or starring in a small indie film about a queer black love story? Running with a torn A.C.L., 100 percent. The most physically painful thing I’ve ever experienced.

Do you bring an athlete’s discipline to acting? For sure. It’s the same thing. Mental sports. I think if I hadn’t become an actor, I would’ve tried to be a teacher or a coach. I just try to educate myself every day, and I try to pick characters who make me have to study and learn something that I haven’t known in the past.

We’re almost two years out from the best-picture Oscar for “Moonlight.” As awards season approaches, how are you feeling about representation in Hollywood? Do you think that we’re in a renaissance moment for black filmmaking in America? Yes, but across the board — for filmmaking, in general. I think representation is had, and it’s continuing to be had.
