• Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese technology executive, was arrested in Canada at the request of U.S. officials on Saturday — the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China met to discuss a trade truce. The detention may bolster efforts to contain China and Iran, but it could upend trade talks between the world’s two largest economies.

• News of Ms. Weng’s arrest sent stock markets around the world tumbling on Thursday as concerns of an emerging cold war between the United States and China intensified.

• A new study utilizing satellite imagery says North Korea is expanding a missile base that would be one of its most likely sites for deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
