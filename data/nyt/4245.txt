‘I don’t mean the hard things, like love, but the awkward ones, like how funerals are fun sometimes or how it’s exciting to watch buildings burning.’

— From “Evening in Paradise: More Stories” (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2018, Page 59), by Lucia Berlin.

One of the only childhood dreams I remember is a nightmare in which my favorite toy, a stuffed gorilla named Gorilla, was destroyed in a tragic fire. What makes the dream impossible to forget is not its sadness but the odd feeling of pleasure it brought — a melancholy satisfaction that was woven directly into the grief. I remember feeling guilty when I woke up. But there was no denying the power of that dark joy.

We all experience this sometimes: feelings that are the opposite of what we know we’re supposed to feel. As Lucia Berlin’s narrator points out, these are the things we don’t talk about. Funerals can be fun. Burning buildings are exciting.

Whether or not we acknowledge these awkward truths, they influence our lives. They are like the dark matter of human psychology, tugging us out of any purely rational orbit.
