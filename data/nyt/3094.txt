If President Trump has foreign policies that they will take advantage of, we’re just thinking about the human part of them. And I think they’re the same, and in the region we are the same. I think we have to take advantage of what we have managed to do, advocate for what we can do locally helping the work force, helping the people in education and business and commerce and trade and services. And in the human part I think we’re also integrating that in the region.

MR. FAULCONER You’re always going to have obviously different national views. But we really spend a lot of time on the ground locally, advocating at the national level and advocating in terms of policies that are really on the ground. And when it comes to that, if you’re doing it right there shouldn’t be a lot of partisanship, and that’s one of the things that I’ve always stressed since I was elected.

The first go-around, there’s always going to be a lot of partisanship on the national-international level. On the local level, it’s incumbent upon us to try to cut through some of that and work together.
