All the members of my family loved music in our own private ways — except my father.

As children we spied on my mother while she lemon-Pledged the coffee table, swaying to “I Hear a Symphony” by Diana Ross and the Supremes. Before music traveled wirelessly, my older brother spent hours connected to Led Zeppelin by a twisted cord that swirled up to bulging headphones. My younger sister stayed behind closed doors, emerging years later having mastered the lyrics to every rap and hip-hop song of the ’80s and ’90s.

I favored the soundtrack to “Annie,” tap dancing my way across the lemon-lime colored linoleum kitchen floor for months after receiving the album as a present. It telegraphed my secret — being gay. Disappearing into Broadway soundtracks ignited my spirit, much to the chagrin of my father.

A working-class auto-body painter, he preferred reading the local newspaper, The Pottsville Republican, uninterrupted and receiving a hot meal at the dinner table by 5 p.m.

Our attempts at bonding failed miserably.

Fishing felt like an endless waiting game as we struggled to fill the hours with conversation. My line always drifted downstream amid my daydreaming.
