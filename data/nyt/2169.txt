LONDON — Nadia Murad and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who won this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for their campaigns to end mass rape in war, condemned on Monday what they called the international community’s indifference to wartime sexual violence and pleaded for new efforts to arrest or punish those responsible.

“Thank you very much for this honor,” said Ms. Murad, 25, a Yazidi woman who was forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State, “but the fact remains that the only prize in the world that can restore our dignity is justice and the prosecution of criminals.”

Two months after being jointly awarded the prize, Ms. Murad and Dr. Mukwege, 63, a gynecological surgeon from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has treated thousands of women in a country once called the rape capital of the world, delivered blunt and searing speeches at the Nobel awards ceremony in Oslo.

In a year when survivors of sexual violence and the #MeToo movement focused the world’s attention on sexual abuse in the home and the workplace, the award cast a spotlight on two regions where women have paid a devastating price for years of armed conflict.
