WASHINGTON — In one of their final acts in the House majority, Republicans released a letter on Friday urging their Senate counterparts to pick up their politically charged inquiry into the handling of the F.B.I.’s investigations of President Trump’s campaign and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and called again for the appointment of a special counsel to study the matter.

Detailing some of their findings, the chairmen of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees said it appeared to them that the F.B.I. had treated the Trump and Clinton cases differently, cutting Mrs. Clinton and her associates crucial breaks while assigning agents who privately exchanged reams of messages bashing Mr. Trump to investigate his campaign’s links to Russia.

“It is not the discovery of bias that is so destructive to fairness, it is the existence of it,” the chairmen, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, wrote of the officials.

They also used the letter to resurface Republicans’ contested charge that the F.B.I. abused sensitive surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign associate believed to be compromised by Russia.
