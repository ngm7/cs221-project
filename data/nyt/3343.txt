Here is a quick rundown of what happened in Texas and what the ruling means for your open enrollment and beyond.

Why did a Texas judge strike down Obamacare?

In a lawsuit filed this year, a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general challenged the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the requirement that people have health insurance — known as the individual mandate — is unconstitutional, and therefore, so is the entire law.

At issue was whether the individual mandate still compelled people to buy coverage after Congress reduced the tax penalty for people who do not have health insurance to zero dollars. (In 2017, the average tax penalty was $708, according to preliminary data.)

In his ruling, Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas said the individual mandate “can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress’s tax power.” Judge O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, said that he would not “parse the A.C.A.’s provisions one by one,” but that he had to invalidate the whole law.

That does not mean the Affordable Care Act is immediately null. The judge did not issue an injunction to stop federal officials from enforcing the law, and a group of states led by Democrats have promised to appeal the decision.
