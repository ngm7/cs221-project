Hi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes — though I think we should reframe, just this once, because starting Monday we’ll no longer be on Standard Weeknight Time. Even now, it feels like Christmas week, as I’m constantly searching for Scotch tape and scissors.

So let’s rechristen this one Five Dishes, period, flexible dinners that won’t keep you in the kitchen for untold hours, will produce leftovers you’ll long for, and are appropriately fabulous or cheese-capped to serve to guests. (If you need five ultrafast recipes, here’s last week’s newsletter; you could’ve been eating that hot honey shrimp in the time it took to read this sentence.)

Have ideas for me or kitchen dilemmas? I’m dearemily@nytimes.com. I truly love hearing from you, so thanks for all your notes.
