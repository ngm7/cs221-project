About 85 percent of Americans live in places that might be considered at risk, he said. “You have to protect yourself by making yourself stronger,” he added, with design and construction that help the population withstand and recover from disaster.

Professor Isaacson, also a native New Orleanian, said the lessons of Hurricane Katrina had yet to be learned in other vulnerable parts of the country. Hospitals in the city had to be evacuated in 2005 because the hurricane caused extensive power blackouts — seven years later, during Hurricane Sandy, New York hospitals also had to be evacuated. Now, New York is doing what New Orleans had to do, taking steps like strengthening buildings, hardening power infrastructure and elevating generators.

To a large degree, New Orleans has made its way back since Hurricane Katrina. More than 17.7 million people visited the city in 2017 and spent an estimated $8.7 billion, a record. There are more restaurants for them to choose from than there were before the storm.

The city has regained roughly 81 percent of its pre-Katrina population, and many neighborhoods no longer show signs of the flood. But the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward still has less than half its pre-hurricane population.
