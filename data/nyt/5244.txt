With more travelers visiting South America, the region has begun attracting luxury hotel brands looking to satisfy the growing demand.

According to Virtuoso, a global network of luxury travel agencies, their clients are seeking less-discovered places where they can experience local culture, nature and history. “South America ticks all those boxes,” said Karen Goldberg, a managing director at the company. “Brazil is our fastest-growing hotel market in the region, followed by Colombia and Peru.”

Oetker Collection, a high-end European hotel brand, chose the Brazilian city of São Paulo to plant its first flag on the continent. Opening in May of last year, Palácio Tangará is a 141-room urban resort set in the 26-acre Burle Marx Park (rates from $370). Its Michelin-starred restaurant was also the first project in this part of the world for the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten. This October, Four Seasons unveiled its first Brazilian hotel in São Paulo’s up-and-coming Parque da Cidade district (rates from $375).

Further north, French hotelier Thierry Teyssier will debut his wandering hotel concept, 700,000 Heures, next June in two three-bedroom residences near Lençóis Maranhenses National Park (all-inclusive rates from $2,000 per night, per couple). In July, the state of Bahia will welcome Anantara Maraú Bahia Resort on a pristine stretch of coastline along the Maraú Peninsula. The 30-room beach resort will feature a spa and water activities ranging from surfing and diving to deep sea fishing and speedboat excursions. Six Senses Formosa Bay resort is expected to open in 2021, spanning 6,350 acres on a former coconut plantation and mangrove forest in Rio Grande do Norte.
