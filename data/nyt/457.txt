Do you recognize this “standout steer?" Named Knickers, he was last week’s internet sensation. At 6 feet 4 inches tall and more than 1.4 tons (2,800 pounds), it is roughly the height of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson but weighs about 11 times as much.

A related Times article examines what made Knickers so popular, and concludes that he is “familiar,” “relatable” and “inspiring.” Do you agree? What is your reaction to this giant steer? What, or who, in your life does he remind you of? Why do you think he has drawn worldwide adoration?
