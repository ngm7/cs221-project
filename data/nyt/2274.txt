Many of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren’t particularly holiday-focused.

We dug up 10 of those reviews from our archives, which we’ve rounded up here, along with info on where to stream them. Below is how the critic Vincent Canby reviewed “A Christmas Story” for The New York Times on Nov. 18, 1983:

There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in “A Christmas Story,” but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.

The film, which opens today at the Guild and other theaters, is about growing up in the early 1940’s in a middle-size city in Indiana. In particular it’s about 9-year-old Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) who, more than anything else in the world, wants to own a genuine Red Ryder air rifle, one that comes complete with a shockproof compass and a sundial set into its stock.

“A Christmas Story” tells how Ralphie fares in his campaign to win such a Christmas present from his father and mother (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon) and a good deal of what it was like to be young in pre- World War II Indiana.
