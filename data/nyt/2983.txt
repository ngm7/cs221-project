SEOUL, South Korea — Only two of the more than 480 Yemeni asylum seekers who arrived on a South Korean island this year after fleeing the catastrophic war in their home country have been granted refugee status, officials said on Friday.

The Yemenis arrived in Jeju, a tourist island off the southern coast of South Korea, in the first five months of this year, capitalizing on the island’s no-visa entry policy. As the sudden influx of asylum seekers spawned anti-migrant sentiment across South Korea, the central government changed its policy in June to require visas for citizens of Yemen.

On Friday, the Justice Ministry said that the government had completed screening applicants seeking for refugees status, granting the privilege to only two of them. Both were Yemeni journalists who faced the risk of persecution if they returned home, the ministry said. The government did not reveal their identities.

The government has allowed 412 Yemenis to remain in South Korea on temporary humanitarian visas on the condition that they leave once the situation in Yemen has stabilized.
