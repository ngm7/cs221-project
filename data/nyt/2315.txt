In North Carolina, the last remaining school district to allow corporal punishment voted in October to ban the practice, effectively ending corporal punishment in the state — even though it is technically still permitted by law.

In certain locations, especially some rural areas, many parents find it culturally acceptable and even preferable for a child to receive a few swats rather than a suspension.

“The districts that still have corporal punishment are quite supportive of it and are convinced that it ‘works’ to change student behavior” despite the fact that “there is no research examining this question,” said Elizabeth T. Gershoff, a professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied corporal punishment in public schools.

Punishments are not distributed equally.

A recent Government Accountability Office report examining federal data from the 2013-14 school year found that black students, boys and disabled students are punished at greater rates than their peers. Black children, for example, were overrepresented by about 22 percentage points among students receiving corporal punishment.

An earlier study published in the journal Social Policy Report examined data from the 2011-12 school year and found similar disparities. In both Alabama and Mississippi, black children in some school districts were more than five times as likely to be physically punished as white children were, the data showed.

Both analyses also demonstrated that boys were much more likely to be physically punished than girls, and that disability disparities were all too common.

Legislators are trying to shield students with disabilities.

Over the last two years, lawmakers in Tennessee and Louisiana have passed legislation banning corporal punishment among students with disabilities.
