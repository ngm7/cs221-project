Before reading the article:

Earlier this year, the Senate Intelligence Committee began a bipartisan investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and beyond. On Dec. 17, it released two new reports that it commissioned about the Russian campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media platforms.

The reports found, among other things, that the Russian influence campaign in 2016 was run by a St. Petersburg company called the Internet Research Agency, owned by a businessman, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. They also stress that the I.R.A. created social media accounts under fake names — designed to pass as belonging to Americans — on virtually every available platform.

The reports identify some of the most popular of the images and themes created by the I.R.A. Take a look at some of their posts in this article. Then, based on what you see, respond to the following questions:

• What are some of the main themes you see represented in these posts?

• Who do they seem to be targeting? How do you know?

• Taken together, what seems to be the purpose of these posts? What might the Russians have been trying to do? Why?
