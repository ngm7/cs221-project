The earthquake drew instant comparisons to the one that heavily damaged downtown Anchorage in 1964. That earthquake, the most powerful on record in the United States and the second-strongest anywhere, was magnitude 9.2; it killed more than 100 people and caused a tsunami that destroyed many small towns along the Alaska coast.

Friday’s earthquake struck just seven miles from Anchorage, but the fact that it was relatively deep — nearly 30 miles below ground — combined with the rigorous building code enforcement in the region helped mitigate a potential catastrophe. There have been no casualties reported in connection with the earthquake, and only two reports of structure collapse.

And so, even though significant aftershocks continue to awaken people in the night, by Sunday most Alaskans had already started putting the quake behind them.

Teodore Odena, 27, said that the response has been true to Alaska, through and through.

“We have tough skin,” Mr. Odena said during breakfast at Snow City Café in downtown Anchorage. “No offense, but you look at the Lower 48, and you hear every time they have a snowstorm. Dealing with the elements, Alaskans have that resilience, we just push forward.”

Mr. Odena was on his way to work at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game on Friday morning, and at first he thought he had a flat tire. He realized it was an earthquake when the road started bouncing up and down and the swaying streetlights began to flicker. When he got to his office, furniture had toppled over and had partially blocked a hallway as people were evacuating.
