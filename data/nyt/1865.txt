When it comes to her career, the actress Felicity Jones is game for taking on a range of roles, including the fierce Jyn Erso in “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in “On the Basis of Sex,” the biopic on the Supreme Court justice that will be out on Dec. 24.

In beauty matters, Ms. Jones, 35, is a bit less adventurous but still willing to switch up her regimen if it’s good for her sensitive skin. Raised in England, in the Bournville village of Birmingham, she now lives in London, where you may find her at her favorite yoga studio.

Skin Care

I get up and wash my face with water. Then I pull my hair back and run down to the gym. It’s the best way for waking up and putting yourself in a good mood.

When I come back, I exfoliate — I do that once or twice a week. I use a product by Caudalie that has a very fine grit. It’s not too abrasive. Or I use this cleanser by La Roche-Posay that’s amazing for sensitive skin. A lot of products do irritate my skin, so when I find something that works, I’m fairly loyal.
