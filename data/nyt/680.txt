When he knew he wanted to go to Greece, he first priced flights on traditional travel sites to get a sense of how much it would cost to pay cash, which might be a better deal than paying with points.

“Being FIRE doesn’t mean I have to do anything,” he said. “It doesn’t mean paying cash is a bad decision. It means I want to maximize value. I think that’s what permeates my life: How do I maximize value?”

He compared the costs of flights in dollars and points. If he found, for example, a flight for $600 or 60,000 points, cash would be the better option. He divides the cost in dollars by the cost in points, and if the result is less than 2 cents a point, he’s unlikely to go for the deal.

Maximizing rewards requires understanding the system, which can be complicated. “It does require some level of organization, there’s no question about it,” said Mr. Barrett, a retired C.P.A. “You have all these logins, you have these credit cards and you have to spend a certain amount.”

He uses a spreadsheet to organize his accounts and all the necessary information, and takes advantage of the site awardwallet.com, which alerts him to expiring points.
