WASHINGTON — The Army has charged a Special Forces soldier with premeditated murder in a shooting that happened nearly nine years ago in southern Afghanistan, according to military documents obtained by The New York Times.

The accusations against the soldier, Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, are the latest chapter in a winding story that began after he told the Central Intelligence Agency — during a job interview in 2011 — that he had killed a suspected Afghan bomb maker a year earlier, during the battle for the city of Marja in Afghanistan’s volatile Helmand Province.

Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, a spokesman for Army Special Operations Command, confirmed the charges on Friday and said a preliminary hearing date had not been set. Task and Purpose first reported the charges.

The military opened an initial investigation into the 2010 shooting after Major Golsteyn admitted to it to the C.I.A. The Army closed the case in 2013 without charging Major Golsteyn, but later stripped him of a Silver Star, one of the highest awards for valor, and an elite Special Forces tab. He was also issued a letter of reprimand.
