To hear his friends and collaborators describe him, the singer and rapper XXXTentacion was an inspirational legend in the making at the time of his death.

Last month, to promote his clothing line, Bad Vibes Forever, his mother appeared in an Instagram video to say “his message was essentially to heal” and that he was “spreading love and light to the world.” A week later, a news release for a major-label single called him the “voice of his generation.”

“He’s going to go down as a Tupac,” Sebastian Baldeon, a producer, D.J. and songwriter known as Diablo, who worked with XXXTentacion when they were both starting out in South Florida, said in an interview. “The music he was putting out was so good, and so beautiful, and the fact that he was taken from society and his family and his friends left such a big impact on people.”

XXXTentacion, born Jahseh Onfroy, had built a huge audience before he was fatally shot during an attempted robbery in Deerfield Beach, Fla., in June. His first two official albums generated nearly 5.5 billion streams, according to Nielsen Music, and he had more than eight million Instagram followers hanging on to every word of his posts and stories, which like his music, were emotional missives that addressed depression and anger. He was just 20 when he died.
