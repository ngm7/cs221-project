After the family of former President George Bush announced his death on Friday night, the tributes and condolences began pouring in.

Within hours, students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University in College Station, Tex., came together — somewhat instinctually, according to the school newspaper The Battalion — for an on-campus candlelight vigil in his honor.

By Saturday, more formal funeral arrangements for the 41st president were taking shape.

Mr. Bush, who died at home in Houston, will soon be taken to Washington. President Trump, speaking from the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday, said that the plane that is known as Air Force One when the president is aboard will transport Mr. Bush’s coffin. Mr. Trump said it was “a special tribute that he deserves very much.”

Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives announced that a bicameral arrival ceremony for Mr. Bush will be held at the United States Capitol in Washington on Monday at 5 p.m.
