While Wollman is the marquee public rink in the city, there are dozens of places to skate in New York, from Prospect Park to Coney Island to Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island. In fact, there are plans to convert the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into an enormous nine-rink complex. Skating is a citywide affair, and has been for a long time.

In the 1950s, skaters spun and wobbled to canned organ music, rumbas and fox trots. Visitors cooled their heels while the ice was cleaned by enjoying candy apples, hot dogs and 25-cent pizza pies. By the late ’70s, rinks began to experiment with disco music. (“It makes the skaters wild,” a manager said in 1979, though it was unclear if he meant that in a good or bad way.) But early risers who made it through the frigid dawn to Lasker Rink, at the north end of Central Park, could skate without music, accompanied only by the meditative whispering of blades on newly squeegeed ice.
