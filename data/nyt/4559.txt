An article on Thursday about extreme weather misstated the findings of a report by Munich Re, a reinsurance company, on damages caused by tropical storms in 2018. The company reported that tropical cyclones had caused $51 billion in losses worldwide, not that the hurricane season caused $51 billion in losses in the United States. Additionally, the long-term annual average of $34 billion in losses, as calculated by the company, is for tropical cyclones worldwide, not hurricanes in the United States.

An article on Tuesday about a new birth control program referred incorrectly to a change in the estimated rate of unintended pregnancy among low-income women in the Title X family program in Delaware. The rate is estimated to have dropped 24 percent between 2014 and 2017; it is not expected to result in a 24 percent decline this year.

Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about legislation aimed at protecting Israel from boycotts referred imprecisely to the status of Gaza. Israel withdrew from Gaza and does not consider it occupied. Hamas, which governs Gaza, does consider it occupied because Israel still controls most of its borders.

BUSINESS

An article on Saturday about withdrawing money from retirement accounts referred imprecisely to the tax benefits of qualified charitable distributions. The distributions are excluded from taxable income, but taxpayers cannot also take a deduction for the same gift on their tax return.
