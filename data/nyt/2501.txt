Here are three of their stories:

‘We’re actually living it’

“Imagine with me: You’re about to turn 13, and your entire life you have to live knowing you may not see your dad for a really long time,” Kendall Williams said into a microphone at a rally in July outside the Capitol, on the eve of another birthday celebrated with only one of his parents.

Kendall’s father, Keith Williams, is serving more than 22 years in prison after being accused of drug conspiracy, money laundering and gun possession. He has been imprisoned for all of Kendall’s life. An estimated 2.7 million American children have a parent in prison, a situation that is linked to higher rates of poverty, lower educational attainment and a host of other ills.

“You eventually communicate with him, and build a relationship, but the more the relationship builds, the farther apart it feels you are,” Kendall said at the rally. “And eventually, all you want to do is give him a big hug, to comfort him and let him know that you still love him. But you can’t — because you’re 500 miles apart.”

That day in Washington, traveling with his sister and his mother, Danielle Williams, was Kendall’s first visit to the capital from their home in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The family attended a session about how to lobby Congress before they went to see aides to Alabama’s senators about the criminal justice bill.

“It’s so important for us, because we’re actually living it,” Ms. Williams said on Wednesday. “In no way are we saying our loved ones shouldn’t be incarcerated. We’re just asking that they have just sentencing, just treatment.”
