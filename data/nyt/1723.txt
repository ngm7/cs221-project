The president smiled, index fingers raised. “Don’t tell me you’re NA GA DA IT.”

I started to sweat. I chugged the rest of my beer. “Got an idea!” the president said. “Secret Service guy right outside the door. His name is Brian — why don’t you use my voice and see if you can trick him into thinking it’s me.” Everybody stared at me in anticipation. So I did it.

“HEY BRIAN, I KNOW YOU’RE DOING THAT SECRET SERVICE THING, BUT CAN YOU COME IN HERE FOR A SECOND!”

The agent opened the door and leaned his head, looking slightly confused. “Its O.K., Brian, just having a little fun!” the president said.

The next day I met with the president in the Oval Office with his advisers. The plan was that the staff would be assembled in the East Wing, “Hail to the Chief” would play, and I would come out as George Bush to the surprise and delight of everyone.

So there I was, hidden off to the side of the room, which was packed. I was nervous. They loved the president. How would they react to me? “Hail to the Chief” began playing, I emerged from the alcove and started doing Bush making a Santa’s list.

“Love socks, stripy socks, also would love a pumpkin-colored tie — very festive, very pumpkiny.” Trust me, it’s killing, and I could see the president laughing really hard. I pulled out all the stops — “NA GA DA IT,” “wouldn’t be prudent,” “Santa doing that thing he does in that whole area over there.” Eventually the real Bush came up, and he did me doing him in front of me, and then I did him doing me in front of him. Paula and Barbara were behind us laughing.
