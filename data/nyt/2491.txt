Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER at New York City Center (through Dec. 30). This troupe continues its run at City Center with its “Three Visionaries” program, opening on Friday. It spotlights dances created by the artistic directors who have presided over the company since its formation in 1958: Alvin Ailey, Judith Jamison and Robert Battle. From Jamison, the artistic director emerita, are excerpts from “Divining” and “Forgotten Time.” Battle, its current artistic director, offers “Mass” and “Ella,” and from Ailey, its founder, there are the classics “Cry” and “Revelations.” Another program pick is “Timeless Ailey” (on Saturday), a presentation of rarely seen Ailey dances, including “Pas de Duke” and “The Lark Ascending.” Both are gems.

THE BANG GROUP at the Flea Theater (Dec. 20, 7 p.m.; through Dec. 22). In “Nut/Cracked,” dancers deliver a sonic holiday extravaganza as they tap out snappy rhythms with the help of point shoes and Bubble Wrap. In his rendition of “The Nutcracker,” the choreographer David Parker explores Tchaikovsky’s score, as well as versions by Duke Ellington and Glenn Miller. The cast is large and features students from the Dalton School, Frank Sinatra High School for the Performing Arts and e.g. dance.
