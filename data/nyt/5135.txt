Re “Forget Trump. Act on the Climate,” by John Kerry ( Op-Ed, Dec. 14 ):

As Mr. Kerry correctly states, “Scientists tell us we must act now to avoid the ravages of climate change,” and he recommends investments in “clean technologies” and in “low-carbon infrastructure.”

In fact, the only reliable and globally effective solution that can win the broad political support required is revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend legislation. A bipartisan group of representatives has just introduced such a bill: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by an amount greater than President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan or the United States’ commitment under the Paris climate agreement calls for.

It would do so by collecting a carbon fee from producers, importers and sellers of fuels that emit greenhouse gases and rebating much of the proceeds to all United States citizens and other lawful residents. This would help to lighten the burden of higher fuel prices and should diminish both politically conservative opposition and the kind of grass-roots resistance recently seen in France. It can and must be passed, for the sake of our grandchildren.

Get rid of all the plastic things you own and do not buy new things made of plastic.
