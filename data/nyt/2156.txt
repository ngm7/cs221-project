Mr. Chua introduces other characters, including a tiger whose halves (front and hind) talk to each other. Portrayed by two of the actors in an ingenious get-up (Karen Boyer designed the costumes), the beast is too silly to be scary. And that’s part of the problem. Many comic elements — gossiping pandas, a rap by the princes — are played so broadly that little seems at stake. Briskly directed by Chongren Fan, the show is fun, but watching it feels more like cheering pro wrestling than like witnessing a struggle for the soul of an empire.

“The Emperor’s New Clothes,” at the Clurman Theater, is as devoted to making children reflect as to making them laugh. Adapted by Barbara Zinn Krieger and devised and directed by Adrienne Kapstein, the play begins in the present in Central Park, where a girl, intent on texting, sits down next to Andersen’s famous statue. The statue (Emmanuel Elpenord) stirs to life, though the girl seems to think that he’s just a stranger, reading. After he persuades her to look at his book — she starts with “The Princess and the Pea” — he vanishes, and she’s swept into the world of his stories.

Portrayed as a bewildered but intrepid young soul by Ayla Bellamy, this nameless heroine becomes not just an onlooker, but a key player, in the tales that follow. At first taken into confidence by the crooks promising the emperor a fabulous new wardrobe, she also exposes that he’s, well, exposed. (Don’t worry, parents — he parades in his underwear.) She then finds herself as the helpful kitchen maid in another emperor’s court in “The Nightingale,” only to wind up among birds in “The Ugly Duckling.” To her shock, she discovers that she’s that story’s titular character — and what could be a weirder-looking duck than a human?
