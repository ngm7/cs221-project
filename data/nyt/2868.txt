PORTLAND, Ore. — Daniel Roder, a longtime fan of the Portland Trail Blazers, arrived at their arena about two and a half hours before a recent home game, a full 30 minutes before it was set to open to the public. Roder knew he could not be late, not when his friend Daniel Tikka, with whom he shares season tickets, had given him an important job.

“He’s working tonight, so he couldn’t be here,” said Roder, 69, of Vancouver, Wash. “And when he’s not here, I know that I need to pick up two of these for him.”

Roder pointed to two freshly acquired posters — but not just any posters. For each home game since the start of last season, the Blazers have commissioned an artist from the Portland area to design a 12-inch-by-18-inch game-day poster, basically in the style of old rock concert posters. Each includes the date of the game and the opponent, but the artwork is the star attraction.

In addition to various renderings of roses, trees and snow-capped mountains, which are staples of the Portland aesthetic, the posters have ranged from playful to poignant.
