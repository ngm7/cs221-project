WATERSHIP DOWN on Netflix. The brutality of Richard Adams’s 1972 novel about a group of rabbits banding together to survive against dangerous predators is toned down in this new computer-animated adaptation, a coproduction of BBC One and Netflix. A roster of celebrities give voices to these creatures (John Boyega, Tom Wilkinson and James McAvoy among them, with Ben Kingsley as an evil leader), but, in his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik lamented that this adaptation is a “blandified” take on the tale that is “less a bittersweet story of survival and freedom and more like a summer family action-pic.” He also noted that the rabbits’ “stiff, floaty, uncanny motion looks like something from a ’90s CD-ROM video game.”
