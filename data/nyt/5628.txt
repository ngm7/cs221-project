She prayed that someone special would bring her some of her favorite flowers. She prayed that someone special would walk with her in Central Park. And she prayed that someone special would come along who believed what she believed: that being a blessing to others is more important than just about anything else in life.

Mr. Worthy, a former staff member of the Clinton Global Initiative who works in philanthropy in Bentonville, Ark., had spent his career helping others. As a child in Syracuse he attended church every Sunday, sometimes twice on Sunday, always dressed in a three-piece suit. He volunteered at hospitals, nursing homes and after-school programs throughout grade school and high school.

Yet when Mr. Worthy showed up, Ms. Walley couldn’t see past her own fears.

“I had never been in a relationship before,” she said. “I was afraid of being hurt, afraid of being rejected, afraid of someone loving me.”

She did know him, though. The two had been students together at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. They had both traveled around 700 miles to attend the school; Mr. Worthy from Syracuse, Ms. Walley from Chicago. They had not been friends, although their circles had intersected in numerous ways. Mr. Worthy thought perhaps they had sung in choir together, but couldn’t remember; Ms. Walley thinks she recalls passing him on campus. On a campus of 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students that included only a small percentage of students of color, they did not meet.
