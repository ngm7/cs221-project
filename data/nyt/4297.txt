The Times reported that the secret project used deceptive social media practices in the Alabama Senate election a year ago to boost Mr. Jones and damage his Republican opponent, Roy S. Moore. The effort included the creation of a Facebook page designed to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, as well as what an internal report called a false-flag operation to make it appear as if an army of Russian accounts were following Mr. Moore on Twitter.

There is no evidence that Mr. Jones, his campaign or Democratic Party officials encouraged or even knew about the small-scale effort.

Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and a conservative Christian, said the meddling was a sign of moral decline. “The immorality of our society has seeped into our political system to corrupt our election process, threaten democracy and destroy our country,” he said. “Only an appeal to God and our Constitution can preserve our republic.”

A social media expert involved in the project, Jonathon Morgan, said in a statement that it was designed to “better understand and report on the tactics and effects of social media disinformation,” not to influence the election. But the internal report portrayed it differently — as an aggressive effort to divide conservatives, suppress Republican turnout and drive Democrats to the polls.

The effort, financed by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, is unlikely to have had a significant effect on the outcome, given its modest budget. It cost $100,000, out of $51 million spent on the entire race, including the primaries.
