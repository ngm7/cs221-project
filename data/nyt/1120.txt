• A new blow to U.S.-China relations.

The arrest of a top executive at one of China’s most celebrated corporations threatened to upend a fragile trade truce with the U.S., and put the Trump administration’s national security and trade policies on a collision course.

Meng Wanzhou, above, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested in Canada. Washington is seeking her extradition, and officials said her arrest was the culmination of a monthslong investigation into whether Huawei violated Iran sanctions. A bail hearing is scheduled for today.

Chinese officials demanded her immediate release and state media described the move as a “declaration of war.” Markets around the world dropped amid the tensions.
