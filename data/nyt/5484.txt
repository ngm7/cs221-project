A sable fur coat lands on a young stenographer riding in the upper deck of an open-top Fifth Avenue bus. A turbaned passenger calls it “kismet,” but the Depression-era romantic farce “Easy Living” isn’t so much about fate as the fantasy of getting something for nothing.

Released in 1937, toward the end of the screwball comedy cycle inaugurated three years earlier with “It Happened One Night,” “Easy Living” has risen in critical favor over the decades. Consider it a seasonal gift, revived for a week at Film Forum in an excellent 35-millimeter print.

Screwball comedies are typically populated by madcap socialites, irate plutocrats, plucky working girls, comic servants, idiotic lounge lizards and English-mangling foreigners. All are present in this film directed by Mitchell Leisen from Preston Sturges’s script. The fur coat (priced at $58,000, approximately a cool million dollars today) that falls from heaven on the head of Mary (Jean Arthur) belongs to the spendthrift wife of a blustering tycoon known as the Bull of Broad Street (Edward Arnold).

While the original story, by the Hollywood leftist Vera Caspary, had Mary steal the coat, Sturges downplays class conflict, delivering something out of the Arabian Nights. The Bull hurled the coat off his terrace in a ludicrous domestic spat. When honest Mary, an employee of a youth magazine called The Boy’s Constant Companion, tries to return it, he makes it a present, along with a matching fur hat. Mary is assumed to be the Bull’s mistress but romantic interest is supplied by his ne’er-do-well son, Johnny (Ray Milland), a sleek twerp introduced wearing an ascot at breakfast.
