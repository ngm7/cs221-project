The first phase of the 1.45-mile park, which runs from Gansevoort Street up to West 34th Street, opened in 2009, with the bulk completed by 2014; a spur at 10th Avenue and West 30th Street is still in the works and expected to open next year.

Once the park was up and running, Ms. Skura quickly became a fan. In fact, after selling her condo for $2.8 million in 2015, she bought another in the neighborhood, on the other side of the tracks. It is not exactly hidden away. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo, for which she paid $5.5 million, has a park-facing terrace where Ms. Skura sits a couple of times a day.

Noise can be an issue. “There’s a slightly elevated buzz. You can hear people talk,” said Atith Pagdi, whose one-bedroom, one-bathroom cond-op, which cost $800,000 in 2017, has a balcony that serves as a veritable opera box for the action.

Mr. Pagdi, 36, who works for a bank, wasn’t seeking the spotlight when he moved from New Jersey after a divorce. Indeed, to make sure his home-to-be was private enough, he asked a friend to stand in the apartment while he paced the High Line.

“But this is New York City,” he said. “You are bound to be seen at some point anyway, in any apartment, in any neighborhood.”

Besides, Mr. Pagdi added, the convenience of the High Line, which allows traffic-light-free passage from one block to the next, can’t be beat. In addition to hitting the park for early-morning jogs, he uses it for speedy commutes to the beer garden at the Standard Hotel and to his gym near West 17th Street. “The location is awesome,” he said.
