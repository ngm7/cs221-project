A friend of mine, a fellow fact-checker, recently described how strange it is to be one of us right now. Two years ago even family members didn’t know what our work entailed; now we’re getting thanked by strangers for upholding the foundations of liberal democracy.

Fact-checking is a very particular, very quiet profession. We’re the invisible spelunkers sent deep down into the story. We call back subjects; we confirm the spelling of names; we make sure we aren’t saying cement when we should say concrete. Sometimes our job amounts to much more than that, but it never comes with a byline. “It’s a job that’s traditionally meant to happen offstage,” my friend said.

When John D’Agata and Jim Fingal’s “The Lifespan of a Fact” came out in 2012, it was unlikely material for a book, let alone a Broadway play. The slim volume is a quasi-Talmudic exchange, the text of Mr. D’Agata’s essay framed by snide disputes with his fact-checker, Mr. Fingal, in the margins.

I wasn’t yet a fact-checker at the time, but “Lifespan” left a bad taste. How could a writer be so surly, so unkind to the person assigned to help him? It’s a deliberate parody, but not an equal one. Mr. D’Agata frames himself as a grandiose, don’t-you-dare-unweave-my-rainbow-type Byronic villain; Mr. Fingal frames himself as a pedant. It’s clear who the hero is supposed to be.
