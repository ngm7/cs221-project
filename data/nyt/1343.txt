In a move meant to stabilize an organization still reeling, and barely standing, in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, U.S.A. Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis.

Kathryn Carson, the federation’s newly elected chairwoman, characterized the bankruptcy filing as a reorganization, “not a liquidation,” of the federation, which oversees the sport of gymnastics in the United States.

More than 300 plaintiffs, including Olympic gymnasts, have sued U.S.A. Gymnastics for failing to protect them from Nassar, the former national team doctor, and the mediation process with some of Nassar’s victims was “not moving at any pace,” Carson said. She said she believed the bankruptcy, which was filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the southern district of Indiana, will hasten claim payments to all the plaintiffs.

“We owe it to the survivors to resolve, fully and finally, claims based on the horrific acts of the past and, through this process, seek to expedite resolution and help them move forward,” she said in a statement.
