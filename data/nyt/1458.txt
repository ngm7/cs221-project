I like to think of myself as someone who enjoys running and spend a lot of time running. But I’ve got nothing on run streakers, meaning those who run at least one mile every day. The current longest official streak is being run by Jon Sutherland of West Hills, Calif. He’ll hit 50 years on May 26, 2019. He’ll have two years and 39 days more to run if he wants to break the record set by Ron Hill, who ended his streak last year.

On Nov. 26, Scott Partenheimer, a German teacher at Haddon Township High School in Haddon Township, N.J., hit five years. I’ve known Partenheimer since high school, and have run into him dozens of times at local races and running events — and had no idea he had set out on a streak of his own. So I asked him about it. Here’s our conversation, lightly edited.

JAM: How did the streak start?

SP: It was 2013. I had just qualified for the Boston Marathon for the second time. I was looking for a new goal, and Runner’s World was promoting their holiday run streak where you run every day between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, and I thought that would be my next goal. New Year’s Day came and I kept going. At the end of 2014, I thought, well, shoot, I’ve come this far, I might as well keep going. I figured as long as I’m healthy, why quit?
