Urban Meyer, who returned Ohio State’s football program to national prominence but who was suspended earlier this year after an investigation revealed he had protected a longtime assistant with a history of domestic abuse, will retire after seven seasons, the university announced Tuesday. Meyer cited health problems as the primary reason.

Meyer, 54, will be replaced by Ryan Day, the Buckeyes’ 39-year-old offensive coordinator, after the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. Day served as interim head coach while Meyer served his suspension during the preseason in August and the first three games of the season in September.

Meyer, one of college football’s most successful and highest-paid coaches, led Ohio State to a national title in 2014, after delivering Florida to the national championship in 2006 and 2008. His overall coaching record is 186-32 and he commands an annual salary of $7.6 million, with a contract through the 2022 season.

Meyer has suffered from stress-related health problems in the past. Yahoo Sports revealed that he was suffering severe headaches, possibly from a congenital arachnoid cyst in his brain diagnosed in 1998. He was seen grabbing his head during a tense, close game against Maryland last month and kneeling on the sideline in apparent distress during an overwhelming defeat of Indiana in October.
