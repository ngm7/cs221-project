The nation bade farewell to former President Bush.

Former President George H.W. Bush was remembered at his funeral on Wednesday as a “kinder and gentler” leader who steered the country through storms at home and abroad. As bells tolled, choirs sang and flags flew at half-staff on Wednesday, the nation solemnly said goodbye to the 41st president.

President Trump attended the funeral, along with the four other living presidents. Mr. Trump did not give a eulogy, but former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and a historian and biographer of the 41st president, Jon Meacham, spoke at the service. And former President George W. Bush gave a moving tribute to his father.

The late president was honored in a series of tributes throughout the week. In Washington on Tuesday, mourners from across the country came to pay their respects to Mr. Bush as his body lay in state at the Capitol.
