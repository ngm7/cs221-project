Previews & Openings

‘MAESTRO’ at the Duke on 42nd Street (previews start on Jan. 3; opens on Jan. 14). Raise a baton to the Ensemble for the Romantic Century’s tribute to Arturo Toscanini. John Noble (“The Lord of the Rings,” “The Substance of Fire”) stars in Eve Wolf’s drama, which focuses on Toscanini’s antifascist activities and is scored to music by his contemporaries. Will it be, like Toscanini, pitch perfect?
