TUESDAY PUZZLE — Merry Christmas to all who celebrate and, for those who do not, Wordplay wishes you short lines at the movies and a happy General Tso’s Day.

When a holiday that is associated with a lot of visual icons — like Christmas trees, Santa Claus and reindeer — falls on a Sunday, solvers are more likely to see a puzzle with a visually entertaining theme, simply because the 21x21 Sunday grid provides room for that kind of creativity. Puzzles like this one by Mary Lou Guizzo or this one by Liz Gorski are good examples.

When the holiday falls on a weekday, constructors have to make do with what they can pack into a 15x15 grid. Bruce Haight is a bit late with one of his Christmas tasks, but better late then never, I say.

Tricky Clues
