In her online profile, Abigail seems like the perfect nanny, and that’s what Tom and Evelyn need to make their problem go away. They’ve been dealing with this hassle ever since Tom’s brother died and left his young children in their care.

What with their go-go global lifestyle — so many planes to catch, so many TED Talk-style lectures to give — they’re a less than ideal choice, guardian-wise. Surely the children’s upbringing is an obligation they can outsource?

“We’re really looking for someone to take over the kids completely,” Tom tells Abigail shortly into the job interview, and if he speaks with the obliviousness of the egregiously entitled, that doesn’t deter the levelheaded nanny from signing on.

The children, Miles and Flora, live with a housekeeper at Tom and Evelyn’s country home, and soon Abigail moves there to join them. In the interest of full disclosure, her new employers might have mentioned that the place is riddled with ghosts.
