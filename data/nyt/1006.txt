When the New York City commissioner who oversaw a much-criticized response to a recent snowstorm was told to resign late last week, he refused to go, insisting that he speak directly to Mayor Bill de Blasio.

That, it turned out, was no easy ask: In two and a half years, the commissioner, Joseph Esposito, had not sat down for a one-on-one meeting with Mr. de Blasio, according to the mayor’s public schedules. On Monday, the two finally met at Gracie Mansion to discuss Mr. Esposito’s fate.

The dispute over Mr. Esposito’s status is another recent example of how Mr. de Blasio has maintained a diminished presence at City Hall, allowing his attention to stray more and more. And with a diminished focus at the top, there are signs, as with the Esposito episode where he delegated the task of firing the commissioner to a deputy mayor, that the practical mechanics of government are running less smoothly.

Mr. de Blasio, in fact, rarely meets with many of his commissioners, according to the schedules, at times making it difficult for department heads to advance new ideas at City Hall, or to inform the mayor about problems at their agencies.
