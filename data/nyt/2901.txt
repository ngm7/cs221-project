Before he began hosting “All In,” which airs weeknights on MSNBC, Chris Hayes was already something of a multiplatform brand. There were bylines in progressive magazines like In These Times and The Nation, stints subbing for Rachel Maddow and other future MSNBC colleagues, a well-received book about meritocracy in America, an energetic Twitter account, and, of course, “Up,” where Mr. Hayes moderated brainy political debates for the network’s weekend-morning audience.

Now the youngest face of the network’s prime-time block, and the recent winner of his second Emmy, Mr. Hayes, 39, finds himself confronting the private and public demands of the cacophonous media-political environment in which he plays a leading role. He fears missing bedtime for his three children, and worries about “the ungodly amount of caffeine” he consumes. Twitter, he says, “feels like smoking three packs a day.”

The steady disintegration of New York City’s subway system, which he took while growing up in the Bronx and rides to work each day, is particularly troubling: “There’s literally nothing more important to the functioning of New York than public transit!”

Such anxieties are difficult to separate from Mr. Hayes’s appeal to the left-leaning audience of MSNBC, his engaged Twitter followers and his growing bookstore crowd. (His second title, “A Colony in a Nation,” was published last year.) Mr. Hayes won’t necessarily dispel anxiety about the future of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or of human civilization. But he recognizes the nature and magnitude of the concern, and the impatience of those, including himself, who want to do something about it. We connected in early October.
