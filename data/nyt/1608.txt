If a stack of documents released on Friday by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and by federal prosecutors in New York were too much to keep up with, why not conclude your week with a bedtime story in the company of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.?

“Saturday Night Live” opened this week’s broadcast in the Trump Tower bedroom of Eric (played by Alex Moffat), as he timidly told his older brother, Donald Jr. (Mikey Day), that he feared something sinister was in his closet.

Day told him: “Eric, there’s no boogeyman in your closet. Have you been watching the news again? You can’t watch that stuff, bud. It’s too grown-up.”
