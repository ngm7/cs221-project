Good morning. Samin Nosrat visited the Israeli chef Sarit Packer in London earlier this year, and brought home a recipe for the breakfast cereal Packer serves (above) at Honey & Co., the tiny Middle Eastern restaurant she runs with her husband, Itamar Srulovich. As Samin wrote for her “Eat” column this week, Packer’s cereal is based on a Turkish breakfast pudding called ashure, but with a better, crisper texture. Packer’s employees call the stuff “crack.” When Samin first tasted it, she ate half a bag.

Make Packer’s version of ashure today and you’ll be set for a week of morning happiness, whether you eat the cereal with yogurt or milk. It’s easy to do save for the business of acquiring ingredients, though most of them may be easily found at Middle Eastern markets and health-food stores. The outlier: ground mahaleb, from the seeds of the wild cherry tree. For that, if the market can’t provide, you may need your Internet browser.

Dinner tonight: beef and broccoli. Make enough rice to go with it so that there’s some left over to freeze. Then, one of these days, you can use it for kimchi fried rice.

Monday night, I like the idea of Ali Slagle’s new recipe for tomato-Parmesan soup. Ali pairs it with toast dusted with Parmesan. I think I’ll accompany mine with a grilled cheese sandwich.
