To the Editor:

In “Emissions Surge, Hastening Perils Across the Globe” (front page, Dec. 6), the quickening rate of global carbon emissions is likened to a “speeding freight train.” “Gas-guzzling SUV” might be the better analogy. Sadly, America has led the way in creating a global appetite for these lumbering, fuel-wasteful giants.

When Congress created a more lenient standard for “light trucks” as a detour around corporate average fuel efficiency standards in the 1970s, the stage was set for a full cast of trucks masquerading as passenger vehicles. In November, light trucks garnered more than 70 percent of new motor vehicle sales.

Instead of wringing our hands at the closing of GM plants that make ordinary cars, why don’t we call on Congress to create a unified fuel efficiency regime that erases the fake distinction between cars and light trucks?

In doing so, we would begin to correct an environmentally catastrophic wrong here at home while sending a strong, if belated, message to the many countries where car ownership is rapidly rising and SUVs are becoming the new vogue.
