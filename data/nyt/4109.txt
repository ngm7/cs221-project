As gender norms become more elastic, drag has burst like a glitter cannon into the mainstream. Think “RuPaul’s Drag Race” on TV or “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Broadway. Drag queens are appearing more frequently onscreen to “pull the wig down from the shelf,” as Hedwig might put it.

But in three recent films and shows — “A Star Is Born,” “Dumplin’” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” — drag queens play second fiddle to the straight women who take center stage. They prod these films and shows, which are all about performers and performances, to work out what “real” and “authentic” mean, sometimes at the cost of the drag stars.

At the beginning of “A Star Is Born,” the director, co-writer and lead Bradley Cooper has his country singer, Jackson Maine, wind up at a drag bar and discover Ally (Lady Gaga, no stranger to drag herself), her fake eyebrows as thin as pencil lines to evoke the French chanteuse whose song she will interpret for the audience. While the show is emceed by D.J. “Shangela” Pierce and Willam Belli, actual drag stars, Ally is notably the only performer that night who doesn’t lip-sync, and the only woman, a privilege she acknowledges to Jackson in the dressing room after the show. “I mean they would never normally let a girl sing one of these shows,” she says modestly, “but they’ve always loved my voice. It’s an honor really. I get to be one of the gay girls.”

The movie’s distinction is clear: what the drag queens do is artifice, predicated on a kind of fakery. What Ally does is real, daring to look the audience in the eye as she pauses her performance of “La Vie en Rose” to gaze at Jackson, who gazes at her, because, unlike the other women performing that night, she has truth in her.
