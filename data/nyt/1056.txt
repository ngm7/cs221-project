PARIS — As the men’s World Cup was winding down last summer in Russia, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, used his final news conference to heap praise on the video assistant referee system, which had been used for the first time at the tournament. It had become, Infantino declared, “difficult to think about the World Cup without V.A.R.”

It remains to be seen whether Infantino was referring only to the men’s game when he essentially called the technology indispensable.

To the dismay of some top players and coaches in the women’s game, FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, has not confirmed whether V.A.R. will be used at the Women’s World Cup next summer in France. For some, the organization’s failure to take advantage of the technology — already widely used in men’s domestic leagues and coming soon to the UEFA Champions League, club soccer’s highest-profile competition — is yet another sign that the organization sees female players as second-class citizens.

“The men had it at their World Cup,” said Becky Sauerbrunn, a veteran defender for the United States women’s team. “The women should have it at theirs.”
