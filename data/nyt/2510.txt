“Martyr” is one of those vague social tragedies that you wind up halfway believing, in part because the director’s convinced you, and also because the people starring in it seem existentially worn out — by life, sure, and maybe by all that vagueness.

They’re playing bored young men withering in what should be the prime of their lives, and even though they don’t have a lot to act, they capture the numbness, grief and rage that come out of strife. They do what they can, with feeling. And the movie deepens into something haunted.

It’s set in a poor section of Beirut and revolves around Hassane (Hamza Mekdad), who’s sleeping on a mattress on his parents’ living room floor after having quit possibly yet another job. (He didn’t like the way he was being treated.) Instead of looking for work, though, he hits the craggy seashore with three of his buddies.
