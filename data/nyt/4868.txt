An Italian Delicacy for Michael Kors

They share a love of leopard print, blackout sunglasses and building mega-brands. But when Michael Kors purchased Versace from its founding family for over $2.1 billion in September, how much of an Italian lesson did he really get? Sure, he may be familiar with Versace’s archives, but what about the local cuisine? Kors can quickly get up to speed by tasting the sweetly spiced and lard-covered Prosciutto di Carpegna, made from pigs raised in the northern and eastern parts of the country, not far from Milan. Each ham takes some 20 months to produce, and the soft, silky slices are newly available in the United States.

The Scent of Pencils for Elena Ferrante

Few authors have written more eloquently and wrenchingly about female friendship than Elena Ferrante. Now that the first four of her Neapolitan Novels have been turned into the HBO mini-series “My Brilliant Friend” — with the promise of more installments to come — we will once again be plunged into the world of Elena and Lila. While much about Ferrante remains a mystery, any writer would surely appreciate this tongue-in-cheek fragrance diffuser by Anya Hindmarch, which contains ceramic reed “pencils” that soak up a lightly woody scent to perfume the air around it.
