The clock will never strike midnight for Walt Disney’s “Cinderella”; Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison can perpetually dance all night in “My Fair Lady”; and the dinosaurs of “Jurassic Park” can live without fear of extinction: These are three of the movies that the Library of Congress has chosen for induction into its National Film Registry this year.

On Wednesday, the library plans to announce, as is its annual custom, that it has chosen 25 motion pictures to add to this registry, helping to ensure their preservation. Other films that have been selected this year include Alfred Hitchcock’s adaptation of “Rebecca”; “Hud,” the epic Martin Ritt drama starring Paul Newman; James L. Brooks’s media satire, “Broadcast News”; “Eve’s Bayou,” the feature directing debut of Kasi Lemmons; Ang Lee’s Academy Award-winning film version of “Brokeback Mountain”; the musical “On the Town,” starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra; and Stanley Kubrick’s terrifying take on “The Shining.”

Lemmons said in a statement that she learned of the honor upon returning from production on her next film, “Harriet,” about Harriet Tubman. The director added, “As a black woman filmmaker it is particularly meaningful to me, and to future generations of filmmakers, that the Library of Congress values diversity of culture, perspective and expression in American cinema and recognizes ‘Eve’s Bayou’ as worthy of preservation.”

The roster also includes the John Sturges thriller “Bad Day at Black Rock”; the Blake Edwards melodrama “Days of Wine and Roses,” starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick; Orson Welles’s “The Lady From Shanghai,” with Rita Hayworth; the documentaries “Hearts and Minds” and “Monterey Pop;” and footage from a 1908 expedition to record Native American life in Crow Agency, Mont.
