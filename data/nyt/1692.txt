See, Cuchna is more than a music nerd. He’s a scuba artist, deep-diving into Ocean’s art and emerging with little bits of treasure, which he delivers in a congested monotone. It isn’t just Cuchna’s assumed assertion that Ocean’s work is as bountifully ornate as Lamar’s or West’s. It’s that the show, which is now being produced by Spotify, thrives as an achievement of contemplative audio.

The show’s time with Ocean’s debut, “Channel Orange,” makes leaps of interpretive wonder, followed by long stretches of corroborating music clips. Maybe the allusions to color on a song like “Pink Matter” mean this. Or maybe they mean that. Sometimes the combination of insights adds up to one possibility. But what’s especially revelatory about the Frank Ocean episodes — but, really, Cuchna’s entire project — is the way all this sleuthing isn’t about finding a final answer or a means to an end. It’s actually just another opening. No art or artist is ever fixed. And so the show still lets some of Ocean’s mystery be. — WESLEY MORRIS
