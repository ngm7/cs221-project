LAS VEGAS — The last time the Yankees had to stew on the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series, they reacted by going on a free-agent bender — shelling out a total of $458 million for Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran five years ago.

Their approach this off-season has been far more restrained.

To fortify their greatest need — their starting rotation — they quickly re-signed C.C. Sabathia for one more season at $8 million, traded for talented but oft-injured James Paxton, and on Wednesday were closing in on landing a familiar face and a dependable arm — the left-hander J.A. Happ.

Happ, 36, who spent the last three months of the season with the Yankees before becoming a free agent, has agreed to the framework of a deal — two years with a vesting option — that had not yet been finalized late Wednesday night, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it until it is signed.

While the Yankees were unwilling to commit to a six-year contract for their top free-agent pitching target, Patrick Corbin, which would have carried through his age 35 season, Happ’s deal could take him through his age 38 season.
