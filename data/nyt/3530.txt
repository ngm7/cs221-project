Q: For the last few years, the building across the street from mine in Manhattan has been blowing litter and leaves from the sidewalk into the middle of the street, rather than sweeping them up and discarding the debris. Recently, my own building and others nearby began doing the same. Aside from the noise every morning, this doesn’t solve the litter problem — it just moves it down the street. A number of us have complained to management, but they’ve ignored us. What to do? I’d rather not use 311 against my own building.

A: Leaves pile up on the streets and sidewalks this time of year, often blowing into vestibules. It is not uncommon for supers or maintenance workers to blow the leaves onto the street, timing their chore for the days when street sweepers are scheduled to come, in the hopes that they will take care of the mess, according to Steven W. Birbach, the president of Vanderbilt Property Management. Mr. Birbach said he urges the buildings he manages to avoid this tactic.

“We try to tell them, what are you doing?” he said. “It does no good. You’re just wasting time. It just swirls around and comes back.”

Property owners are required to maintain their sidewalks, keeping an area of up to 18 inches into the street free of debris, according to the Department of Sanitation. That means they can’t just blow the mess down the street and hope for the best.
