It was supposed to be a cheery holiday performance in front of the large Christmas tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the music school ensemble seemed to be singing for its survival.

The school, which has served blind and visually impaired musicians in Manhattan since 1913, finds its existence imperiled by its own parent group — a charitable organization with a mission to help the blind.

Singers were led into place by volunteers or guide dogs, but before the music started, the school’s executive director, Dr. Leslie Jones, told the crowd inside the museum’s Medieval Sculpture Hall that the school would be “separating” at the end of the month from its longtime parent entity, Lighthouse Guild International.

This was a cordial take on the situation.

The Lighthouse Guild sent a letter to students in June — in large print, for the visually impaired — notifying them that the 105-year-old school would no longer be part of the Guild’s future and that it must leave the Guild’s building on West 64th Street.
