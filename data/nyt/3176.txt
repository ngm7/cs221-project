That may be all it takes for him to realize his miscalculation about your friendship (and that you know he’s lying). If it doesn’t, turn it up a notch. Ask him gently: “Did you really chat with Cardi B today?” If he persists with his lying, spare your friends their justifiable annoyance and see him on your own. And forget the ski trip for now. Fantasy name-dropping in the lodge is not a fun après-ski activity.

Thanks for Trying, but This Is Worse

I’m 13. My parents divorced when I was 10. My younger brother and I live with our mom, but we stay with our dad some weekends. On big holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, my parents spend the day together like they’re still married. That would be fine, but they always end up fighting with each other and make the day stressful for my brother and me. Can I say something?

Absolutely! Talk to your mom about this one night when you’re both relaxed. Give your parents credit for trying to pull off these happy family holidays. Believe it or not, they’re doing it for you and your brother.

But the fact that they fail consistently (and stress you out in the bargain) suggests a need for change, or a greater effort on their part. My hope is that by raising the issue softly, your mom won’t feel criticized but will see that she and your dad should start working on a new holiday plan.

How Did We Meet? The Way Everyone Else Does in 2018

After 22 years of not having a boyfriend, I finally do! I moved to a midsize city after college and met a great guy on a hookup app. We’ve been dating for six months, and things are going great. We come from the same state, so we’ve arranged for him to meet my family over Christmas. The problem: I’m really embarrassed that I met my first (and only) boyfriend on a hookup app. And I know “How did you meet?” will be the first question my aunts and grandmother ask. What do I do?
