Re “Is Klobuchar Too ‘Minnesota Nice’ for Democrats in 2020?” (news article, Nov. 27):

Your exploration of the potential presidential candidacy of Senator Amy Klobuchar asks whether the Democratic base can get behind an amiable and levelheaded Midwesterner with a reputation for pragmatic bridge-building and concrete accomplishments.

Perhaps the answer lies in the recent midterms, in which centrist female candidates won enough suburban and rural districts to return the House to the Democrats. Success in 2020 will have to focus on the Midwest, where narrow margins in three states gave the Republicans the Electoral College in 2016.

Winning a national election will require progressives to reach beyond their comfort zone with a candidate whose ideology and demeanor engage a broad spectrum of voters instead of assaulting them. Americans exhausted by Donald Trump’s meanspirited virulence will be unlikely to extend confidence to those who continue to play his game.
