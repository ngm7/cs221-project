“You’re basically investing in your future health care and future needs,” said Stephen Maag, director of residential communities for LeadingAge, an association that represents organizations and businesses in the aging industry. “Then whatever you need within the continuum the community provides will be covered. So you’re basically locking in what you’re going to have to pay for the rest of your life.”

Mr. Maag said the average age nationwide of people entering the communities is the low 80s. Residents tend to stay seven to 10 years.

Entrance fees average about $300,000, but in the luxury category that can be substantially higher. Entrance fees for the largest units at Fountaingrove Lodge, two-bedroom bungalows, are about $1 million, with monthly charges of more than $6,000.

“Our occupancy rate is 100 percent,” said Robert May, the executive director, in October. Mr. May said there were 100 residents and a waiting list of nearly 70. (The need is acute for any housing in Sonoma County after last year’s wildfires destroyed thousands of houses.)

Demand is also high in North Dallas, where construction of the $140 million Ventana by Buckner luxury complex is due to be completed next year. The 186 apartments, ranging from 950 to 2,000 square feet, with concierge-level services and fine dining, have entrance fees from $400,000 to $1.8 million and monthly charges as high as nearly $11,000.

The mission is to “completely treat everyone like a V.I.P.,” said Rick Pruett, the executive director. “All those little touches, like you’d see at some of the finer operating hotel chains and resort centers.” Eighty-one percent of units are reserved.
