Sales are solid this year, Mr. Gatanas said. He had sold 1,200 trees by the start of the week, and had just 250 left (though more were on the way, he promised).

Finding trees to sell is a bit of a scramble, though, and has been for years.

History: The shortage has its roots in the 2008 economic crash.

Because so many people lost their jobs, Mr. Gatanas said, he figured he’d have fewer customers. He bought fewer trees, and tree sellers nationwide did likewise. Growers responded by planting fewer trees.

Rinse and repeat a few times, and here we are.

“It wasn’t an environmental disaster,” he said. “It was man-made.”

Economics: Mr. Gatanas has been keeping prices steady, though.

As he has for years, he sells a three-foot “Charlie Brown” tree for $39.99. Complain about the price if you want, but some other stores in town charge $50 for a comparable tree.
