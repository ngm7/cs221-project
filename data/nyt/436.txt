My wife was raised Catholic with a big C, and I was raised Jewish with a small j. As a tacit compromise, we are bringing up our daughter with such godlessness that when visiting my in-laws’ home, she mistook the crosses hanging in each room for light switches. Nonetheless, come December, there is but one figure who reigns supreme among her set: he of the ho ho hos.

I know it sounds Grinchian, but the Santa thing irritated me immediately. In theological terms, there is little love lost between me and Judaism. But culturally — with my unwavering devotion to Stern on the radio, Roth on the page, Dylan on the stereo and kugel in the oven — I am a Hasid. So, when we were about to make our holiday debut as parents, I informed my wife that we would be celebrating the season not only with Santa Claus but also with Hanukkah Harry.

“He’s the Jewish version of Santa,” I explained, a touch of sanctimony creeping into my voice.

My wife, who grew up in Italy, seemed skeptical. “Did you learn about Harry at Hebrew school?” she asked.

“I don’t recall,” I said, truthfully. “It was a Reform temple, so they mostly just talked about the Holocaust. But I definitely remember him from when I was a kid. At some point, there was even a ‘Saturday Night Live’ skit parodying the Harry phenomenon.”
