Good luck, and as always, please post questions in the comments or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. We’re excited to see what you come up with!

Rules and Guidelines

1. Choose some piece of academic content: something you’ve been reading, discussing or learning about in school. It may be a work of literature, an event in history, a concept in civics, a phenomenon in science or something else entirely. It can be as small as a single haiku or as large as a world-changing event like the Industrial Revolution.

2. Find something published in The New York Times anytime in 2018 or 2019 that you think connects to your chosen subject in some interesting, meaningful way, and explain how.

You might think about the questions we raised above: What relevance does your academic content have to our world today? What does it have to do with your life and the lives of those around you? What parallels do you see between it and something happening in our culture or the news? What lessons does it offer for us today?

3. You can pick any article, Op-Ed, image, video, graphic or podcast, or anything else you like, as long as it was published in The Times in 2018 or 2019. Our two related lesson plans give you many suggestions for how to do this. (Note: If you are not a subscriber, The Times offers free access to five articles each month, and articles we link to in our Activities for Students, such as our writing prompts and Articles of the Day, don’t count against the limit. In addition, many libraries have subscriptions to The Times in print and online, and some even offer online access to patrons.)

4. Use the form below to tell us, in 450 words or fewer, how and why the two things connect.

5. The deadline is Jan. 21, 2019, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern.

6. Like all our student challenges, this one is open to anyone 13 to 19 years old, anywhere in the world.
