Opening a package of homemade food mailed by a stranger and eating the contents seems like the last thing anyone would want to do at a time when distrust and fear seem woven into our national psyche.

But that’s just what Liz Larkin, 52, who runs a home-baking business in Pound Ridge, N.Y., intends to do this month, when she’ll ship off a box of cookies and scones to someone she has never met while she waits for another person to send her a box filled with gifts from the kitchen.

“It sounds a little weird, right?” Ms. Larkin said. “But connecting with a stranger like this is just a cool thing to do. Doing good is kind of contagious.”

Like many cooks who turn to food as a gift, she knows the magic that can come from trading something delicious and homemade with another cook. But neighborhood cookie swaps and even more informal exchanges are increasingly hard to find.
