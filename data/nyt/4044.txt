Dr. Baselga, a prominent figure in the world of cancer research, had helped found the journal and served as an editor for the past eight years. The A.A.C.R., which he formerly led as president, concluded that his omissions were inadvertent and said it would allow Dr. Baselga to continue publishing in its journals.

“Dr. Baselga is a valued member of the A.A.C.R. with acknowledged expertise in clinical and translational cancer research,” Dr. Margaret Foti, the group’s chief executive, said in the statement.

Dr. Baselga’s disclosure lapses have prompted a broader discussion over the influence of the drug and health care industries on medical research, including whether journals should do a better job of ensuring that researchers accurately report their corporate ties. Teaching hospitals across the country have reminded faculty of their obligation to disclose, and some have begun re-examining which relationships are appropriate.

Dr. Baselga resigned as chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering in September after The New York Times and ProPublica reported that he had failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from health care companies in dozens of research articles. He also resigned from the boards of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a maker of radiation equipment.

Contacted for comment, Dr. Baselga provided the resignation letter he sent to the A.A.C.R. In it, he thanked the cancer organization for its “deliberate and thorough review” and said he takes “great heart from the panel’s finding that my failure to disclose was inadvertent. I understand, however, that the situation made it difficult for me to continue in a leadership role.”
