The Marvel Cinematic Universe bookended this week with trailers, dropping the second clip for “Captain Marvel” during “Monday Night Football,” then releasing the first look at “Avengers: Endgame” on Friday. And that may not be all: The first trailer for “Spider-Man: Far from Home” is expected to be released on Saturday.

After introducing Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, in September, Marvel rolled-out a follow-up explaining that she’s part of the Kree, a race of noble heroes in a seemingly endless war with the evil Skrull empire. The new clip also provided a peek at Annette Bening in a mysterious role as a scientist who tells Carol, “Your life began the day it nearly ended. We found you with no memory. We made you one of us, so you could live longer, stronger, superior. You were reborn.”
