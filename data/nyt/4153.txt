Alibay Barkley always wanted to name his son something unique. He initially campaigned for Machiavelli, in honor of his favorite rapper, Tupac Shakur, who nicknamed himself for the 15th century Italian philosopher. But Barkley’s wife, Tonya Johnson, vetoed that.

Eventually, they agreed on Saquon, a name that had small roots in the Johnson family tree. It was similar to his older sister’s name, Shaquona, yet made him distinct from almost anybody else in the country.

The rarity of Barkley’s name would soon be commensurate with his talents on the football field. During an otherwise miserable season for the Giants, Barkley, the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, has emerged as an offensive wunderkind offering some hope for the future.

In the process, he has positioned himself to join an exclusive club of mononymous superstar athletes: Tiger, Serena, Shaq, LeBron and, at least in New York, a quarterback named Eli. There will be no need for a cheesy branding effort like “TB12” or “RG3” with Saquon.
