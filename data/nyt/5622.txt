The fine artist Lina Iris Viktor has agreed to settle a lawsuit she filed against Kendrick Lamar and the singer SZA saying their music video for “All the Stars,” part of the “Black Panther” soundtrack, used her work without permission.

Viktor, a British-Liberian artist, was approached twice by representatives of the movie asking if her work could be used in the film or as part of its promotion. After deeming the agreement too restrictive, she said no.

Nonetheless, part of the video “is so clearly a copy of the artists’s work,” according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York in February. Viktor sued for a portion of the profits from the sale of the single and the movie’s soundtrack.
