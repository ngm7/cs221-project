Marky Ramone, who became the drummer for the Ramones in 1978, doesn’t do Christmas carols. But he does plan to play at least one Christmas tune, he said, at his “Holiday Blitzkrieg” show, scheduled for Dec. 21 at the Gramercy Theater. Ramone, now in his 60s, was born Marc Bell in Brooklyn and became a Ramone after the original drummer, Tommy, left the band. On Sundays, when he is not away touring with Marky Ramone’s Blitzkrieg, his current band, he can often be found putting together set lists for his SiriusXM show, “Marky Ramone’s First Wave Blitzkrieg,” and curating his internet radio channel, “Marky Ramone’s Punk Rock Blitzkrieg.” He lives with his wife of 34 years, Marion Flynn, in Brooklyn Heights.

GET PUMPED I get up about 10 or 10:30 and I’ll take my bike out for a nice ride near the Promenade, past the park, a mile away. That gets me pumped to start my day. Then I go play the drums. I have a studio in Brooklyn that I go to, Complete Studios. I rehearse there on my own. I don’t need the band because I know everything by heart. I do my 40-song Ramones set list, then I go home and take a shower.
