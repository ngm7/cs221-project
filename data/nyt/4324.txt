While many townhouses in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, are tricked out with glowing Santas and elaborate Nativity scenes, one homeowner has put forth a different decorative concept. Gennaro Brooks-Church, 47, a “green” builder, has covered his house with a patterned wall of plants. He maintains that it is one of the first living facades in New York.

Instead of twinkling lights at his house, rhododendrons, brass buckle, sprinter boxwood and heuchera black pearl celebrate the onset of winter. When the inflatable Mickey Mouse elves go back into storage, Mr. Brooks-Church’s display, completed just before Thanksgiving, will last year-round, with minimal care. An added benefit: as opposed to sucking electricity, the plants will help insulate the home, reducing heating and cooling bills.

The 600-square-foot green exterior is the latest addition to Mr. Brooks-Church’s show-home, which includes a stream on the roof. He lives there with his three children and the family dog.

This is an edited and condensed version of a recent conversation with him.

Q. What inspired you to create the wall?
