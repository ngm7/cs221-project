Nostalgic operagoers have packed Lincoln Center these last few weeks for a peek at Plácido Domingo’s star turn in Puccini’s “Gianni Schicchi,” in his 50th season with the Metropolitan Opera. But while I share everyone’s fond memories of the man’s Cavaradossi and Otello, the bigger surprise for me on the night I attended was the ingenue who burst onto the stage behind Mr. Domingo. Making her Met debut in the role of Schicchi’s young daughter, Lauretta — she of the plaintive and elevator-friendly “O mio babbino caro” aria — the Russian soprano Kristina Mkhitaryan stopped time with her honeyed, robust voice. Suddenly, one could hear the sound of a thousand fluttering programs as the audience raced to find out who she was.

Ms. Mkhitaryan is a relative newcomer to the world’s big stages but is conquering them fast. Born in Novorossiysk and a 2004 graduate of the Galina Vishnevskaya Theatre Studio in Moscow, she honed her talent at the Bolshoi before placing in several major competitions, like Operalia last year. These last few months have been big for her: She debuted as Micaela in the Royal Opera’s “Carmen” and, over the summer, made waves in “La Traviata” at Glyndebourne. Part of her appeal lies in her glamorous sound: She floats the high A flat as though it were made of mist. But the other exciting thing about Ms. Mkhitaryan is undoubtedly her seductive but bold presence onstage. As a review in The Telegraph wondered excitedly in May: “Is Kristina Mkhitaryan the new Netrebko?”
