Sometimes movies or songs don’t age well, but you find yourself watching or humming along to them anyway, offensive lyrics, wince-inducing scenes and all. That is especially true during the holiday season, when traditions and modern sensibilities collide in an acute way.

So, how do you balance your warm feelings for a traditional song or movie with whatever cringe factor it may sometimes produce?

That is the question we asked Times readers this week. Many responded with reflections on holiday standards, like the song “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” as well as pop culture standbys one might encounter at any time of year, like “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.”

We also heard from Shane MacGowan, the lead singer of the rock band The Pogues and the writer of its 1987 Christmas song, “Fairytale of New York,” which has been criticized in recent years for its derogatory language toward women and gay people.
