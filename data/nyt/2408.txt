Before reading the article:

Are animals intelligent? Think of a time when you observed intelligence in an animal. What details do you recall? What makes you think this was an example of intelligence rather than instinct?

Next, watch this two-and-a-half-minute YouTube video of an octopus carrying coconuts. Do you see any evidence of intelligence? What do you see, and what do you think it shows?

Now, read the article, “Yes, the Octopus Is Smart as Heck. But Why?,” and answer the following questions:

1. Why does Piero Amodio believe that the octopus carrying coconuts in the video demonstrates intelligence?

2. What is a cephalopod? What other animals are included in this group? What type of intelligence do other smart animals typically exhibit that cephalopods don’t?
