Andrea Carla Michaels: This fun idea was all Brian's! I just talked him into making the theme phrases horizontal, rather than vertical. He was going vertical to emphasize the idea of "High" jacks, whereas I thought horizontal would make it easier to spot the theme (especially as it would probably be a Monday).

We put HIJACKS across the center, so we could emphasize that the"JACKS" were "Hijacked" from the answers. I love that the word HIJACKS has HIJ_ _K all in a row. It gave it a subtle extra layer of wordplay/letter fun!

Three of his four original JACKS made it intact (LONDON, RUBY and BLACK). I just helped shore up a fourth for consistency, as Brian's initial idea of JACK FROST was more a thing, not a person.

Very pleased with his initial grid that had the LATIN LOVER and EXTRA EXTRA, as I am a sucker for both Italian men and extra X’s.

This all came together very quickly and easily, considering we've never met. I had a lot of fun with Brian and look forward to another collaboration soon!

Brian Thomas: I needed some help fleshing out an idea, and who better to turn to for an early week puzzle than Andrea? Working with her was a blast — once she ironed out the theme the grid came together nicely (at least we think so!).

I was very happy to work in LATIN LOVER and EXTRA EXTRA as bonus Downs. SURE CAN is a personal favorite, and with some scrabbly letters also sprinkled throughout, I’m hoping there’s something for all to love.

Filling the grid is my personal favorite part of construction, and overall I’m pretty happy with how this turned out. The big north and south areas were toughest to fill, but escaping with just a couple “dabs of glue” isn’t too shabby.

Most of the clues are hers too — they’ve just got a fun, creative spirit to them that really adds to the puzzle. Hope you all enjoy! We’ve got a few other ideas simmering so keep an eye out for that in the future.
