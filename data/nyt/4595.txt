VANITY FAIR on Amazon Prime. Olivia Cooke stars in this new British adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s 1848 satire of British society. Cooke plays the outgoing antihero Becky Sharp, a social climber, with Claudia Jessie as Becky’s more reserved best friend, Amelia Sedley. Michael Palin plays a version of Thackeray, who narrates the series. Cooke’s performance is proudly contemporary, which brings an unexpected energy to this period piece. “The way it was written by a lot of men is that women were very passive and apologetic, and tried to make themselves as small as possible,” Cooke told the British newspaper The Independent earlier this year. “And I just don’t think that’s true for every woman that lived in these times.”



MARVEL’S RUNAWAYS on Hulu. Shortly after this Marvel adaptation by the writers and producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (both of “The O.C.” and “Gossip Girl”) debuted last year, the two sat down for an interview with The Times to discuss the series. “I think we’ve all woken up to the idea that just because there are people in our lives who are figures of authority, it doesn’t mean they’re definitely there to protect us,” Schwartz said. That idea figures heavily into this series, in which a group of super-teenagers unite to save the world from their supervillain parents. Season 2 debuts Friday.
