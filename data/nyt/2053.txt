Here are six people Fixes wrote about in the last year who show what the answer can be: a lot.

Katie Fahey

RESTORES POWER TO THE PEOPLE

“There were great moments in American history when people rose up to correct it when something wasn’t right. I said, ‘Technically, I’m allowed to try. So I’m going to.’”

Last month, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that changed the state Constitution. It created a commission of independent citizens to draw the lines of congressional districts, taking the job away from politicians.

This result is remarkable. Even more remarkable is how it happened. The founder and leader of Voters Not Politicians is Katie Fahey, a Michigan woman in her 20s with no political experience. She wrote on Facebook that she wanted to end gerrymandering. Thousands of volunteers responded. They collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to put the measure onto the ballot, and then went door to door to ask people to vote for it. When the campaign needed money, volunteers asked their family and friends to chip in.
