Ms. Ward defined such success as having the means to solve the problems that compounded with poverty, such as access to health care, a good education and the ability to save money.

Ms. Ward is a professor of creative writing at Tulane University in New Orleans, but lives in DeLisle, a decision she reckoned with in a Time magazine essay published in July 2018.

Mr. Thurston said his ability to leave Washington for Boston, Los Angeles and New York City wasn’t because he was particularly exceptional or smarter. Instead, he was lucky. But the narrative around black poverty, he said, is one that’s systemic and often born of moral and personal failure.

Efforts to improve cities aren’t always developed from local communities themselves, Mr. Thurston explained, but rather via a path developed and implemented from the outside, often benefiting the new and predominantly white population.

Black people “are like the place holders for the future artisanal food truck industry,” he said, elaborating that it was then their responsibility to react to the economic changes of the neighborhood.

This often creates a pattern of displacement, meaning the community that was supposed to be helped can’t afford to reap the benefits.

The conversation continued in a discussion of rural-urban relationships, like the farm-to-table dining trend: “Is it beneficial or just hipster nonsense?” Ms. Bellafante asked.
