Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

THE BOTANICAL WORLD OF HARRY POTTER TOUR SERIES: POTIONS at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (Dec. 9, 2:30-3:30 p.m.). Who knew that Hogwarts had a campus in Brooklyn? This public garden is inviting eager young scholars to continue their exploration of the Harry Potter world here, where they can find plants that have roots in the real world as well as in J. K. Rowlingâ€™s imagination. Participants will meet at the Steinhardt Conservatory, where each will receive a copy of an O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exam, the kind Harry took. This will ask them to find a list of potion-worthy species, like squill, cinnamon, ginger and monkshood, in the conservatory, where an alchemy table will also offer demonstrations of plant-based chemistry. Hogwarts teachers (garden guides) will provide information and a small take-home prize to each visitor who completes the test.
