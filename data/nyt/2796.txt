Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

APOLLO’S FIRE at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Dec. 16, 2 p.m.). Holiday “traditions” abound in classical programming at this time of year, markers to orient yourself by and reliable standbys for institutions. But this Cleveland-based period instrument ensemble can always be counted on for something a little different. Led by its artistic director, Jeannette Sorrell, and joined by dancers and the singers Amanda Powell and Ross Hauck, this program, titled “Christmas on Sugarloaf Mountain: An Irish-Appalachian Celebration,” explores a Celtic Christmas.
