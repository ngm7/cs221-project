In the bizarre, shambolic universe of “Between Worlds,” a schlubby truck driver named Joe (Nicolas Cage) has sex, repeatedly, with three women, one of whom is dead. Thankfully, necrophilia is not a plot point (with late-model Cage, one never knows where his artistic impulses will lead), as the expired partner operates by possessing the living, seemingly at times via a kind of supernatural coitus interruptus.

This probably explains the baffled-yet-horny expression worn by Joe for much of this dementedly raunchy movie from the writer and director Maria Pulera. Weighed down by a scraggly beard, serious debt and a recently deceased wife and child, Joe is hardly a catch for Julie (Franka Potente), a woman whose otherworldly gifts allow her to exit her body and guide her comatose daughter, Billie (Penelope Mitchell), back from limbo. In Joe’s favor, though, is his willingness to facilitate this paranormal rescue by agreeing to strangle Julie into unconsciousness. And if you think that’s weird, just wait till Billie’s body awakens with Joe’s erstwhile wife as a spiritual hitchhiker.
