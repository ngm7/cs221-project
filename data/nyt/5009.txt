The powerful tsunami that struck Indonesiaâ€™s two most-populous islands over the weekend was the second to strike the country in 2018, a year that has brought a series of disasters to the nation.

Coming without warning, the wave that rose from the Sunda Strait to hit Sumatra and Java late Saturday was thought to have been caused by an undersea landslide set off by volcanic activity.

On Sunday and Monday, residents and rescue workers were left to sift through the hundreds of damaged buildings in search of survivors and victims. As of Tuesday, more than 425 people were killed and more than 1,400 injured by the deadly wave, which reached nearly 10 feet as it washed over the coast.
