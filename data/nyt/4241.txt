In a move that caught many employees by surprise, Laura R. Walker, the longtime but recently embattled president and chief executive officer of New York Public Radio, announced Wednesday that she would leave her job in March.

Ms. Walker has been a towering figure in public radio and the arts for more than two decades. But accusations last year of harassment and discrimination by hosts cast a harsh glare on her management style, prompting Ms. Walker to acknowledge that she had “prioritized growth, and content and programming, over investment in some of the processes and people.”

In her departure memo to staffers, Ms. Walker did not shy away from mentioning what employees have named “The Troubles,” saying “it’s no secret that this past year has been stressful for the organization.” She wrote that she and the station’s board of trustees “agreed that the time has come for me to move on.”

Still, she said, she was “proud of the progress we have made so far in transforming our culture.” And she chronicled a long list of accomplishments since becoming president 23 years ago, including a bevy of journalism awards, key acquisitions like the news site Gothamist and four capital campaigns that have raised more than $160 million.
