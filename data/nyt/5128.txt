Re “When Report Cards Go Out on Friday, Child Abuse Increases on Saturdays, Study Finds” (news article, nytimes.com, Dec. 17):

Childhood discipline and the use of physical violence are very distinct ideas, but as this study depicts, caregivers fail to distinguish between the two. Even more shocking is the fact that this argument has been raised over the issue of classroom grades.

The possibility of being physically abused based on poor performance is a direct result of humanity’s grade obsession. Children are ingrained to believe that a simple number will define their entire lives, but at what cost?

At times, adults fail to understand the problem with dwelling on classroom results; in their eyes, the attribution of self-worth to one’s grades triumphs all. This systematic way of thinking is unhealthy and may lead to emotional overreactions.

Instead, a healthy conversation and offer of help, through a tutor or new workbooks, may be more effective and humane.
