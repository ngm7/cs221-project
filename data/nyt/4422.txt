Here are seven great things we wrote about this week:

Owen Williams of southern Wales shared a story of generosity on Twitter this week.

His neighbor, Ken Watson, had always doted on Mr. Williams’s 2½-year-old daughter, Cadi. Mr. Watson, who had no grandchildren of his own, died recently in his 80s, but it appears that one of his final wishes was to make sure Cadi got a present from him — for the next 14 years.

“He always told us he’d live till he was 100 years old,” Mr. Williams wrote on Twitter, “so these gifts would have taken him up to our little girl’s 16th Christmas.”
