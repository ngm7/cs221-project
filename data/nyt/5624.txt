Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

Pop & Rock

AFROMONDO SHOWCASE 2019 at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 3, 7:30 p.m.). Artists from across Africa and the African diaspora are represented in this lineup, which ranges from traditional musicians to the continent’s latest pop exports. Performers include Ilam, a bluesy singer-songwriter from Senegal; William Cepeda, a Puerto Rican trombonist who fuses contemporary jazz with the island’s folk music; the Nigerian pop singer Jemiriye; and Nkumu Isaac Katalay, who fuses the music of his native Democratic Republic of Congo with Afrobeat — the West African funk popularized by Fela Kuti.

VICTOR CALDERONE at Sony Hall (Jan. 1, 8 a.m.). For those who want to keep their New Year’s celebrations going as long as possible (or perhaps just start them at an unconventional time), Sony Hall, a New York house music stalwart, is hosting a party that begins before most will have had their first bagel of 2019, and lasts well into the night. Calderone, who is the only D.J. on the bill, first earned wide acclaim remixing songs for Madonna; since then, he’s worked with everyone from Beyoncé to Sting.
