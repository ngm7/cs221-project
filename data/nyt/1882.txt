And then, quick as panthers, they were behind me, waving from a bridge festooned with clay vines: “Hello! Hello! Where are you from?”

When I had arrived by rickshaw at Nek Chand’s Rock Garden in Chandigarh, India, I had been prepared to gorge on a 40-acre extravaganza of outsider art. I had not anticipated, though, the sheer joy that would come from sharing that playground with uniformed schoolgirls from the nearby Muslim-majority city of Malerkotla.

And they weren’t even close to the only school group I’d see that day — the place was awash with children and teenagers, leapfrogging over one another, having the time of their lives. Boys in black sweaters with white jeans and white sneakers streamed past my Malerkotla friends, who were streaming past young Sikhs in green turbans, who were streaming past little girls in plaid skirts with pigtail braids.

Most of them were coming from rural areas. Chandigarh, the dual-capital city of the states of Punjab and Haryana, was one of the biggest cities they’d ever seen. And judging from how many of them wanted to “snap a selfie” with me, I was likely one of the only foreigners they’d ever seen, too. Add to the mix families, honeymooning women in elaborate pink saris, the occasional stray dog, and workers asleep on walls. It was such a life-affirming scene that I couldn’t stop grinning.

I’d had my doubts when I’d heard that a rock garden was one of Chandigarh’s — and India’s — biggest calling cards, but then I stepped inside this one and was floored. Think Antoni Gaudí’s similarly sized Park Güell in Barcelona, but homespun, distinctly Indian, and made entirely of industrial waste and found rocks, by the self-taught artist Nek Chand Saini. I thought I’d reached the end at one point, and instead walked into a huge, open expanse filled with mosaic benches, a fun house of mirrors, and pillars hung with swings. Every turn of a corner brought new mosaics, waterfalls and sculptures of imaginary animals.
