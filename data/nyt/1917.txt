“I didn’t want to dig it all back up,” he said.

Remarkably, no fatalities or serious injuries have been attributed to the earthquake, in part because Alaska’s strict building codes are predicated on life in one of the most active seismic zones on the planet, in a northern corner of the Pacific Rim.

But the quake brought a new layer of stress for students in a school system that has already wrestled with tumult. Anchorage, which has some of the most ethnically diverse public schools in the nation, has seen state support for education erode for years. Notably, support for capital improvement projects has fallen away, as Alaska’s economy has struggled with falling oil production and declining revenue from taxes that oil companies pay to drill in places like the Prudhoe Bay, in the state’s far north.

The schools have also seen reverberations from the opioid crisis, which has brought families wrestling with drug and alcohol problems from outlying areas into the largest urban center, Anchorage.

“Our kids are coming to school with a lot more trauma,” said Starr Marsett, president of the Anchorage school board. And budget cuts have not helped, she said, adding: “We have one counselor for every 750 elementary students.”

The schools have seen a drop in enrollment, too, as families have left Alaska, seeking economic opportunities. In each of the last two years, about 500 students have left, leading to funding cuts for schools under per-pupil formulas. A labor dispute with the teachers’ union has dragged on for months. And the prospect of new state funds seemed increasingly tenuous after the election last month of Mike J. Dunleavy, a Republican who has pledged to slash state spending, as governor.

“Everybody is incredibly uncertain right now about what is going to happen,” said Diane Hirshberg, a professor of education policy at the University of Alaska.
