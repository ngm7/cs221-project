“I’m using what was a traumatic experience for me to help promote racial justice,” she said.

Ms. Dumpson, now 22, was singled out after she became the first black woman to serve as American University’s student body president in May 2017. The same day, bananas hanging from nooses were found around the campus.

After news outlets reported on the nooses, Andrew Anglin, who runs The Daily Stormer, posted Ms. Dumpson’s picture and personal information online and exhorted his followers to harass and bully her, a tactic he has also employed against Jewish and Muslim targets.

One of the people who heeded his call was Mr. McCarty, also now 22, a student and actor who had been leading a secret life online, posting hateful messages and songs under the alias “Byron De La Vandal,” a reference to Byron De La Beckwith, the Ku Klux Klan member who assassinated the civil rights leader Medgar Evers. He was identified as Mr. McCarty by an anti-fascist group in April.

The lawsuit stated that Ms. Dumpson constantly feared for her safety amid the relentless harassment, and was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite that turmoil, she graduated from American University and is now enrolled in law school.

As part of the settlement, Mr. McCarty agreed to assist Ms. Dumpson in her legal efforts against his two co-defendants, Mr. Anglin and Brian Andrew Ade.
