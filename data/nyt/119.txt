Shea Weber, in his second game back from a knee injury, scored twice on Saturday night to help the host Montreal Canadiens defeat the Rangers, 5-2.

Artturi Lehkonen also had two goals, and Carey Price stopped 20 shots as the Canadiens ended a five-game skid while giving the Rangers their fourth loss in five games.

Weber, who missed the first 24 game with the injury, which cost him nearly a calendar year, opened the scoring 3 minutes 53 seconds into the game. He unloaded a one-timer from the point for his first goal of the season and first over all since Dec. 5, 2017.

Weber doubled the lead with 7.2 seconds left in the period. He created a turnover in his own zone, raced up ice to join the rush, took a feed from Tomas Tatar — who was prone on the ice while he made a cross-ice pass — and snapped a top-shelf goal.
