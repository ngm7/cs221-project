There’s a story in the New Testament, in the Gospel of Mark, about Jairus, one of the leaders of the synagogue who came to Jesus and fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly: “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.”

When I was 2 years old I became very sick and was unable to breathe on my own. My father, like Jairus, pleaded with God to save the life of his daughter. My throat was cut open so that a machine could breathe for me. How fragile life is, supported by nothing but thin air.

For months an iron lung supported every breath I took, and when the electricity in the hospital failed, Dad would come to the hospital at all hours of the night to hand crank the machine keeping me alive. Dad never spoke about this. He had a humble, quiet faith, and I am the beneficiary of his pleading.

Many of the stories of healing in the New Testament actually have nothing to do with the faith of the person who is healed and everything to do with those who have a relationship with that person. It was the faith of Jairus that was enough for Jesus to heal his daughter. It was the tenacity of the boundary-breaking Canaanite mother that led Jesus to heal her daughter. It was the sheer boldness of the four friends who cut a hole in the roof to set their paralyzed friend in front of Jesus to be healed. And sometimes it was Jesus wanting to make a point that was the catalyst for healing. In all these stories and more, the person who received healing usually had no say in the matter, no agency.

In the New Testament, Jesus would often say before bringing about a physical healing, “Your sins are forgiven.” The first and most important healing was invisible.
