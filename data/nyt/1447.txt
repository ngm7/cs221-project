H.E.R. — the stage name of the R&B singer who earned a star-making five Grammy nominations Friday morning — stands for “having everything revealed.” In fact, the 21-year-old songwriter and multi-instrumentalist behind the project, Gabriella Wilson, is notable for her lack of exposure: For years, she’s played the enigmatic artist, à la the Weeknd’s early rise, hiding her face and insisting on letting the music speak loudest.

Those days may be coming to an end now that H.E.R. sits alongside Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Childish Gambino and Cardi B as top Grammy contenders at the 2019 show in February. The singer will compete for not only best new artist, best R&B performance, best R&B song and best R&B album, but also the big one: album of the year.

Wilson’s studio debut, “H.E.R.”, was released in October 2017 by MBK/RCA, combining two previously released EPs and six new tracks of throwback R&B that also feel at home on SoundCloud. The collection peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard chart, but made fans of Rihanna and, apparently, the Recording Academy.

On Friday morning, after a tour stop Thursday night in Houston, Wilson spoke to The New York Times about breaking through, the power of playlists and how she learned about her Grammy nominations. Though she sounded surprisingly Zen over the phone, the singer insisted: “I’m really not calm at all.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
