The Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis will not play again until at least mid-February, when he is expected to undergo a medical re-evaluation of his surgically repaired knee, the team’s president, Steve Mills, said on Friday.

It remains unclear whether Porzingis, one of the N.B.A.’s most exciting young players, will be able to return at all this season, Mills said. When he is evaluated in February, it will be a year since he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.

“We’d love to see him play,” Mills said, “but we also acknowledge that he is a really, really important part of the long-term future of this franchise, and the one thing we’re not going to do is take any real risk.”

Porzingis, 23, passed recent benchmark tests for strength, quickness and lateral agility, Mills said, and he has also been working out one on one with a Knicks assistant coach for 45 minutes at team practices.
