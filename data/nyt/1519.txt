“I don’t think it’s ever a good thing to force a player into a circumstance where he can’t be successful,” he said. “And when you sign players late in the process and they don’t have a full spring training — or they don’t have the opportunity to have a clear idea of what their role and expectations are going to be with a new team — that hurts the individual, it hurts the teammates that player will join, and it certainly hurts the organization. My plan is not to bargain-shop in February and March. My plan is to be aggressive and strategic in filling our needs as soon as possible.”

Baird, a former Kansas City Royals general manager, worked for the Boston Red Sox last season and saw the impact of an exception to the free-agent flops. J.D. Martinez signed in late February (five years, $110 million) and hit .330 with 43 homers. He helped lead the Red Sox to the World Series, where David Price — who signed for seven years and $217 million with Boston in December 2015 — won the clincher.

Do the 2018 Red Sox, then, prove that aggressive free-agent spending may be a worthwhile gamble after all? Baird would not go that far.

“We can look at the other ones that didn’t turn out; we can surely look at that as well,” he said. “But I also learned in Boston that the culture has a huge impact on those players — the supporting cast, the resources that are around that individual during the bumps and the grind. So the infrastructure that you put those guys into is a really, really important element.”

The Mets’ intangibles will reveal themselves over time, but Amaro — a former Phillies general manager who returns to the front office after serving as the Mets’ first-base coach — said Van Wagenen was off to an encouraging start. He noted that, at the news conference for Cano and Diaz, Van Wagenen thanked numerous Mets staffers, including the scouts who signed the prospects the Mets had just traded.
