“We’re totally prepared for a very long shutdown.” Here we are again, another government shutdown. This time, because of a fight over funding for a southern border wall. “Walls work.” So, why do we have government shutdowns? The federal fiscal year starts on Oct. 1, often without new spending laws in place. Instead, the president and Congress strike a short-term deal to buy more time. If they can’t reach a new agreement before the next deadline, much of the federal government shuts down. This time, it’s a partial shutdown. Some things have already been funded. But still without money: key departments like Homeland Security, Agriculture and Justice. What happens when the government shuts down? Federal workers are either temporarily forced off the job or told to work without pay. Essential services, such as airport security stay in place. And national parks? It differs by state. Some are open, but may be unstaffed or have limited services. So, who’s affected? Nine federal departments and several agencies have closed — 420,000 people have been forced to work without pay. Another 380,000, furloughed. Need a new passport? You might have to wait until the State Department is funded again. Thinking of buying a new house? Expect significant delays at the Federal Housing Administration. So, when will it end? Unclear. Since Democrats reclaimed the House, both sides appear to be digging in their heels over funding for the border wall.
