Across the country, policies vary. In Texas, most schools allow parents to eat in the cafeteria; the Texas Association of School Boards’s website calls lunchroom visits a “great way to be involved with your child’s daily school experience.”

The New York City Department of Education said it does not have a blanket policy, but allows individual schools to determine whether parents are allowed at lunch.

Brian Perkins, a former superintendent in New Haven, and now an associate professor of practice in education leadership at Columbia University’s Teachers College, confirmed that parents lunching with their children was not a new or expressly suburban phenomenon. After seeing the email from the school district, however, he was not surprised by the frustration among parents in Darien.

“Part of my immediate reaction was their communication about why this was important might not have been as clear as it could have been,” Dr. Perkins said. “I’ve learned over time that sometimes communication failures turn small things into bigger things in school districts.”

Then again, he said, often parents can have a serious sense of entitlement when it comes to their children.

“We are in a society where people want what they want,” Dr. Perkins said. “The idea that on its face, I’d be told ‘no,’ that I can’t have lunch with my child, is for some, unconscionable.

“There are a number of reasons why that would be a prudent decision to make in a school district,” he added. “The first thing that came to mind was about space.”
