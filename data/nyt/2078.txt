Fannie and Freddie are the primary sources of funding for mortgage loans in the United States. The companies do not make loans. Instead, they purchase loans from private mortgage lenders, providing those companies with cash to make more loans. The two companies financed 44 percent of new mortgage loans during the first six months of 2018, according to the Urban Institute.

Mr. Calabria has criticized the current housing finance system, in which Fannie and Freddie purchase most mortgage loans and then repackage the loans for sale as securities. He argues that the combination of federal support and the securitization process has encouraged investors to take on larger risks, threatening the stability of the financial system.

As director of the housing finance agency, Mr. Calabria would have some authority to reduce the role that Fannie and Freddie play. He could, for example, require the companies to raise the fees they charge on loans, or limit the maximum size of the loans that the companies can purchase.

But David Berson, who worked as Fannie Mae’s chief economist from 1987 to 2007 and is now the chief economist at Nationwide, said he did not expect big changes no matter whom the administration named to lead the agency.

“Things are working too well, and it would be too politically divisive,” he said.

The Trump administration released a report in June proposing to privatize Fannie and Freddie while continuing to subsidize mortgage loans for less affluent home buyers through an existing program operated by the Federal Housing Administration. Such a plan, however, would require congressional approval, an unlikely prospect given that the House will soon be controlled by Democrats who have long been more supportive of government involvement in the housing finance market.
