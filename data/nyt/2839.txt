Re “Pelosi Tells Trump: ‘Don’t Characterize the Strength That I Bring’’’ (news article, Dec. 12):

At the end of each semester, I leave my students with two words of advice: Speak up. Representative Nancy Pelosi did this, beautifully, in her recently televised meeting with President Trump.

He did everything possible to subordinate her: calling her Nancy, while she referred to him as Mr. President; interrupting her; wagging his finger at her; condescendingly offering his understanding of her discomfort because, after all, she was not yet the official House speaker . The only thing he didn’t do was stand up and hover over her, as he did with Hillary Clinton in the debates.

Yet, with grace and spunk, Ms. Pelosi challenged every insult thrown her way. Mr. Trump invited the press to this meeting because he thought he would put on another show of dominance for his fans. It was Ms. Pelosi’s performance that won the day.

After describing how Nancy Pelosi showed her strong control of the conversation, her command of the facts and her ability to push President Trump’s buttons during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting, why did you have to note that she put on sunglasses and wore a “swingy red coat ”?
