In the months before she hanged herself in 1999, the English playwright Sarah Kane woke up, nearly every morning, at exactly 4:48 a.m. As she went on and off drugs and in and out of hospitals, she wrote her final play, “4:48 Psychosis,” an anguished, mordant, fragmentary work, dissociative in form and content. A throat-shredding scream of a play, it has been staged and restaged since its posthumous premiere in 2000. It is now a chamber opera.

Composed by Philip Venables and directed by Ted Huffman, the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival’s “4:48 Psychosis,” which had its premiere in London in 2016 and opens in New York on Jan. 5, makes music of a play with no delineated characters, few clear scene breaks and no stage directions except for occasional, italicized pleas for silence. “It’s not a piece that works by who says what on stage, and that is wonderfully liberating for an opera,” Mr. Venables said, speaking by telephone from London.

Mr. Venables’s interpretation relies on six voices, three sopranos and three mezzo-sopranos, who convey — together and separately — the competing and often contradictory voices inside one woman’s head. In scenes where a psychiatrist or some other medical professional seems to be speaking, two percussionists beat out the speech rhythms as the text is projected in a rear wall. The orchestra is visible and sometimes the sound overwhelms the singers, Mr. Venables said, “like a kind of really powerful emotion that you can’t overcome.” (William Cole will be the conductor, replacing Richard Baker, who had to withdraw because of illness.)
