About a week after the Camp Fire was fully contained, many who were displaced are now beginning long and frightening journeys. Alexandra S. Levine, a Metro reporter, was covering the aftermath. Here’s our conversation about what’s left, edited and condensed for space.

Jill Cowan: What was the scene like in Chico and Paradise?

Alexandra S. Levine: Paradise was a ghost town; they hadn’t let residents back into the evacuation areas yet, but they’re now gradually lifting those orders.

Chico is buzzing with people. The former Sears store at the Chico Mall continues to be a one-stop shop (set up by FEMA) where the displaced can do everything from replace their licenses to find support for trauma.
