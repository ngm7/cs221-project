Sy Kattelson, a photographer and member of the influential Photo League, who captured workaday New York in pictures of nuance and intimacy for half a century, died on Nov. 24 at a care facility in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 95.

His death was confirmed by his daughter, Raina Kattelson.

Mr. Kattelson joined the League in 1947. A leftist documentary and artistic photography group based in New York, the League championed a new aesthetic and helped shape a generation of young photographers.

He was not as well known as members like Paul Strand, Sid Grossman, Berenice Abbott and Lisette Model, but he set himself apart with photographs that tended to be less political, often showing New Yorkers in unguarded moments as they rode subways, walked the avenues, wheeled perambulators and otherwise went about their urban business.

“Most people doing that type of work were doing poverty-stricken people, like on the Lower East Side,” Mr. Kattelson told The New York Times in 2017. “I started to think, ‘What about people like me, who were not in poverty?’ So I tried to show people what they were living like.”
