With Netflix’s faithful film version of “Springsteen on Broadway,” there’s no need to re-review the show itself. What my colleague Jesse Green wrote when it opened in October 2017 still stands: “As portraits of artists go, there may never have been anything as real — and beautiful — on Broadway.”

Bruce Springsteen’s solo monologue-plus-concert was sold out far in advance during its entire run, with an average face-value ticket price of around $500. For the last performance (on Saturday, the day before Netflix is releasing the film), resale tickets are currently running from $3,000 to well over $40,000 each. Making the show available for the cost of a streaming subscription is an unqualified boon, a greater contribution to the public good than our civic institutions seem capable of at the moment.

Admittedly, the feeling of being in the audience at the Walter Kerr Theater, sharing the distinct but equally electric currents of an unplugged rock show, a cadenced sermon and a shrewdly theatrical entertainment, can’t be replicated. The live experience is inimitable, and the post-show emotional high as you walk out of the theater probably can’t be duplicated, either.

But the film, directed by Thom Zimny and shot by Joe DeSalvo at two private performances this year, has its own compensations. “Springsteen on Broadway” has sold out on the strength of its star’s connection with his huge fan base, and the opportunity to see him do a clutch of his best-known songs in a relatively small setting. But the show’s revelation — and the reason it actually worked so well — was his ability to take the stagecraft he’d honed in rock clubs and arenas and transfer it so effortlessly to the theater.
