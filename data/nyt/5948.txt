A new set of kitchen utensils designed for children (but useful for adults) ramps up the fun, while producing rewards like a well-tossed salad, eggs properly beaten to scramble or a correct measure of flour for a perfect batch of cookies. The handles on the spatulas, spoons and whisk colorfully replicate vegetables, while making the tools easy to grip. Measuring cups mimic an artichoke; measuring spoons, a bunch of bananas.

Q.D. Foodie kitchen tools (set of seven utensils), $49.99, qdfoodie.com.
