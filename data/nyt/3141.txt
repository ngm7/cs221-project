Sondra Locke, an actress who received an Oscar nomination for her first film and starred in a series of movies with Clint Eastwood, with whom she had a turbulent relationship, died on Nov. 3 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 74.

Her death, which was not widely reported at the time, was caused by cardiac arrest related to brain and bone cancer, The Associated Press reported on Thursday, citing a death certificate.

Ms. Locke’s Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress, was for her performance in “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” a 1968 drama, with Alan Arkin, based on a novel by Carson McCullers. She went on to star in several movies with Mr. Eastwood in the 1970s and ′80s, including their first film together, “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” and “Sudden Impact,” part of the Dirty Harry thriller series.

Ms. Locke and Mr. Eastwood’s romance began on the set of their first film, and they lived together for more than a decade. After the couple separated, Ms. Locke sued Mr. Eastwood twice, turning their breakup into a high-profile court battle in the 1990s.
