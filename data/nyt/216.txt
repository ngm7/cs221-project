ATLANTA — In sports, there is bizarre, there is really bizarre and then there is just plain eerie, like top-ranked Alabama’s 35-28 victory over fourth-ranked Georgia on Saturday, which confirmed the Crimson Tide’s spot in the College Football Playoff, whose four-team bracket will be released Sunday.

The Southeastern Conference title game was nearly a mirror image of the national title game 11 months ago, also between these two teams, also in Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

In last January’s game, Alabama Coach Nick Saban benched his two-year starting quarterback, Jalen Hurts, who struggled mightily in the first half against Georgia, for the freshman backup Tua Tagovailoa, who led the Crimson Tide to a victory in overtime. Tagovailoa has put together a Heisman Trophy-worthy season this year.

But on Saturday, it was Tagovailoa’s turn to struggle, and Hurts’s turn to bail Alabama out.

In the fourth quarter, with Alabama trailing by 7 but being outplayed worse than that, Tagovailoa exited with an injury. (Saban later said Tagovailoa had played with a sprained ankle since the first half and had his foot stepped on in the fourth quarter.)
