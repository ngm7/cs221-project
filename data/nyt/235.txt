New Orleans has a good track record for celebrating its native cocktails. The drinks are so beloved by locals that there may as well be huge statues of the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz in Jackson Square.

One classic New Orleans cocktail, however, has suffered from neglect. The brandy crusta is a Cognac drink supported by lemon juice, Curaçao and maraschino liqueur. But its defining aspects — both very theatrical — are a long lemon twist that snakes inside the glass and a sugared rim (the crusta).

The drink was the invention of the New Orleans bartender Joseph Santini, who served plenty of them at his 19th-century bar, Jewel of the South. Cocktail experts believe that the crusta opened the door for many of the cocktail sours to come, not least of all the Sidecar.

“Santini is the guy who was really monumental in the development of cocktails in the state, and he’s kind of gotten short shrift,” said Nick Detrich, a New Orleans bartender.
