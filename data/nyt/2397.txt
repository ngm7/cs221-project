Kaleb had big plans for his best friend, KJ. To him, it was never a question of whether KJ would get out of the hospital; it was simply a question of when.

KJ, after all, had a history of battling a body that betrayed him: A flu shot made him sick when he was 13 months old; he learned he had leukemia shortly afterward; he had two bone-marrow transplants.

And yet KJ — Kenneth Gross Jr. — seldom complained.

“He was happy even though he went through all that stuff,” observed Kaleb Klakulak, a 12-year-old of few words.

But years of chemotherapy and radiation ate away at KJ’s most important organ. By age 9, he had developed congestive heart failure and by Jan. 7, 2018 — a few days after his 12th birthday — KJ was admitted to a hospital full time. He needed a heart transplant.
