Re “50 Years of Unisex Classified Job Ads” (Op-Ed, Dec. 3):

Wyndham Robertson says “access to the pipeline” is not the reason there are so few women chief executives. She reminds readers how things have improved for women seeking jobs since the 1960s and 1970s.

I remember job-hunting in 1974. My high school teachers had warned me not to learn how to type, or “they’ll put you in the typing pool.” So I didn’t learn to type. Two university degrees and a year’s job-hunting later, the only job offered to me was in the typing pool.

Access to the bottom end of the pipeline has certainly improved for women. But the pipeline still narrows for women all the way up to the chairman’s office, even in fields like art history, where women outnumber men.

As long as men continue to dominate top-level jobs, they will continue to control access for women to their ranks. We need to look hard at why so many men, even in fields where women abound, still resist having women as equal colleagues.
