LOS ANGELES — The last year has been a roller coaster with 20 loops for MoviePass and its customers.

The fast-growing subscription service for movie tickets spent months insisting that it was not running out of money despite evidence to the contrary. That emergency loan to keep operating? All part of the plan. That auditor’s report about escalating losses? Ignore it. Abrupt changes in service — some movies are restricted, now they’re not — arrived without warning or explanation.

Now, MoviePass is asking for forgiveness and hoping to move forward by unveiling a three-tiered pricing structure that takes effect on Jan. 1. As part of the course correction, Mitch Lowe, the company’s chief executive, will turn over day-to-day operations of the company to Khalid Itum, an executive vice president at MoviePass. Mr. Lowe, a former Netflix and Redbox executive, will keep his title and instead focus on long-term strategy.

“I don’t believe that today people trust the MoviePass brand,” Mr. Itum said in an interview at a MoviePass office in West Hollywood. “We have to earn back that trust. And we’re going to earn it back not by spending on marketing but by fixing the product.”
