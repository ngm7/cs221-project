I really can’t stay.

No, John Kelly, don’t go just yet. I don’t mind if you called me an idiot. My next chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was even more mean. He said I was a “terrible human being.”

I’ve got to go away.

Please, Kellyanne Conway, stick around one year more, even if your husband hates me more than Al Gore. You’re the best liar I’ve got, much better than a Russian bot. And now General Jim Mattis has up and quit. It's over principle, he says, plus he thinks I'm a dimwit.

My mother will start to worry.

Not so, Vice President Pence, Mother has no reason to flee. I love that you never talk, because it’s always about me, me, me! Mrs. Pence can be as frozen as you in the chair, and I’ll never give either of you a stare. And by the way, Melania’s red Christmas trees really give me a scare.

Father will be pacing the floor.

The evangelicals truly don’t care. I stumped for creepy Roy Moore and they went nowhere. I wouldn’t know the Bible if it fell on my head — that’s why I wanted to use “Art of the Deal” at the inaugural instead. I pay off porn stars and when asked, say no, no, no, but the preachers will always bless my lies and say go, go, go.
