BERLIN — On Friday Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, meeting in Hamburg, elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Angela Merkel as the center-right party’s leader. Given the party’s dominant — if recently weakened — position in German politics, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer will also succeed Ms. Merkel as chancellor by 2021 at the latest.

Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer — or AKK, as she is often called, because even German tongues stumble over that name — won in a tight race against two other candidates: Friedrich Merz, who returned to the political stage after a decade of absence, and the youthful conservative minister of health, Jens Spahn.

Neither of AKK’s contenders would have radically changed Germany’s role in Europe or the world; nor will she. She won’t change the face of German conservatism, either. And yet, Friday felt like a new beginning, for the party and for the country.

The past weeks of intense campaigning by the three conservatives demonstrated both the possibilities and limits of creating a new identity for a big-tent conservative party in a world haunted by right-wing populism and fractured political systems. “We are the last unicorn in Europe,” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a speech on Friday before her election, by which she meant: The Christian Democratic Union is one of the world’s last big-tent parties that can still live up to the name. How true.
