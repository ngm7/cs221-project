The six-month schedule leading into the World Cup is the longest U.S. Soccer has ever announced at one time for the women’s team, and both the federation and the team’s players association praised the benefits — to both sides — of the longer-term commitment.

In the past, the team was sometimes informed about the dates of training camps and matches as little as six weeks in advance, which complicated everything from planning vacations and birthdays to scheduling surgeries and weddings. But those short windows also posed problems for the federation, which had less time to sell tickets for the matches; for fans, who might want to travel to them; and for sponsors interested in rolling out marketing plans related to the team.

The six-month calendar, then, is the most obvious recent product of an improved working relationship between U.S. Soccer and an energized women’s national team players association, which has pressed, both through its collective bargaining agreement and in bi-weekly meetings between the union’s executive director, Becca Roux, and federation officials, for more concrete commitments about when the players will be expected to be available.

“These little wins, which to other people have little meaning, they’re huge for us,” United States midfielder Allie Long said Thursday morning after speaking at a players association forum in New York.
