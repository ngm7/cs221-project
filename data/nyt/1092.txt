Michael R. Bloomberg stood on the red carpet Monday night, smiling his tight smile and rebuffing questions about whether he planned to run for president.

His hearing also seemed to fail when asked if he would wed his longtime partner, Diana Taylor. “I didn’t hear that question,” he said, all three times it was asked.

That was understandable. After all, he was at Lincoln Center to discuss “Paris to Pittsburgh,” a new documentary about climate change financed by his nonprofit foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies.

“It’s critical people understand that something is changing in this world, not for the better,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “And unless we do something, it’s not going to turn out well.”
