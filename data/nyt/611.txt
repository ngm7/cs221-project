Did they keep in touch during these relationships?

In 1983, she was with her son and was pregnant with her second child when they saw each other in Texas and had a pleasant conversation. He had heard she was a missionary and was happy for her. It wasn’t until 2007, when she was divorced and living in Texas, that she found him online. “I was examining my life, trying to figure things out, and looking to find peace,” she said.

He was then 59 and she 56. After a few emails, they met in a cafe and talked. It went well. At first they were cautious. Eventually she asked, “What happened to us?” Both let down their guard and talked about their struggles. Neither imagined a new relationship together but within weeks they felt the same magic they did when they were young.

What was it about each other, this time?

“I could talk to her as honestly as I would talk to a therapist, when we were first together we didn’t know much about ourselves,” he said.

He was still kind and this time she trusted him.

How did they make a new life?

He had his children every other weekend so they spent alternate weekends together. They married Dec. 20, 2007, but kept it a secret from their children for awhile. Within five months, everyone knew.

How did their kids react?They didn’t tell them for a while and didn’t move in together for seven months. Of their eight children, the youngest was 13, the oldest 26 then. Her children were fine, but his were shocked. “In my previous marriage we were good at hiding problems, so the kids didn’t know much about why their mother and I had split,” he said.

What would you have done differently in the first marriage together?Both wished they had stuck with it, but note that their childhoods affected the relationship negatively. Therapy would have helped, he said, but in 1973 that wasn’t an option. Both say they needed tools to deal with conflict and both caution against marrying young.
