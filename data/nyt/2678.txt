“Basically, when they set out to find 50,000 people in a single city, that really resulted in the cities that were a million-plus being in the running and the others weren’t. Now, 238 applied, and a lot of them knew they didn’t have much of a shot but, like, why not give it a go? My hope is that the 236 that lost, if they take half of the energy they put into rallying their community, to driving collaboration, and half of the dollars they were putting on the table to lure them, and refocus that on their start-up community, they might create the next Amazon. So my hope is that the Amazon effort — you know, I know there’s a lot of controversy about it — can actually end up being a catalyst that has long-term legs and sort of the unintended consequence of rallying these communities to focus on the future, lean into the future. And they can only do it if they collaborate. And they only can do it if they understand that start-ups are sort of the seed corn that some of which will become the big companies, like Amazon, of tomorrow.”
