A jury recommended on Tuesday that a demonstrator who drove into a crowd of counterprotesters at last year’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., killing a woman, spend the rest of his life in prison.

The recommendation came four days after the jury convicted the man, James Fields Jr., 21, of first-degree murder in the attack, which also injured nearly 40 other people. Mr. Fields was also convicted of nine other charges, including aggravated malicious wounding and leaving the scene of a fatal accident, for which the jury recommended a sentence of hundreds more years in prison.

The jury’s action on Tuesday is not a final verdict. Under Virginia law, it serves as a recommendation to the judge, who will decide the sentence.

Judge Richard E. Moore of Charlottesville Circuit Court will sentence Mr. Fields at the end of March, said Brian Wheeler, a spokesman for the city. He can order a weaker sentence than what the jury proposed, but not a stronger one.
