“Our players should feel comfortable and confident to take time away from the courts to have a family or recover from injury, and I think these new rules support that,” said Azarenka, who gave birth to her son, Leo, in 2016. “This is a really good first step, and we are using it as a base to continue to look for ways to improve and highlight the importance of mothers working and being on tour. My goal as a member of the Players’ Council is to make sure that the WTA is the pioneer of being the most progressive and inclusive association in sports.”

Azarenka, who was in the top 10 when she went on maternity leave, was not given special seedings as she worked her way back on to the tour, a return that was complicated by a lengthy custody dispute.

Williams’s return from having a child also stretched the boundaries of tennis’s rules about match attire. At the French Open, the first Grand Slam tournament of her comeback, she commanded the spotlight even more than usual with a form-fitting black-and-red suit.

The bold outfit made a splash when Williams wore it in Paris in May, and then created waves months later when Bernard Giudicelli, president of the French Tennis Federation, bemoaned it.

Giudicelli told France’s Tennis Magazine that the French Open would introduce a dress code to prevent such outfits at his tournament, because “one must respect the game and place.”

While Giudicelli’s comments were widely criticized, it was not clear that Williams’s outfit had been within the existing rules. Officials generally have not permitted players to wear ankle-length leggings, or any tight pants without a skirt on top.

The WTA has now made the rule explicit, allowing leggings and midthigh-length compression shorts to be worn with or without a skirt, shorts or a dress.
