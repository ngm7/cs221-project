Brideside, based in Chicago, is trying to solve for a different problem: outfitting bridesmaids. The company started in 2014 as an online-only resource for those dresses that are notoriously hard to find in styles that satisfy groups of women of differing tastes and sizes. Several newer entrants in the industry — like J. Crew and Gap Inc., which had acquired the start-up Weddington Way, had already closed their wedding lines. (Neither company disclosed a reason for the closures.) But Brideside co-founders Sonali Lamba and Nicole Staple, while students at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, thought they had a way to make it work and devised a business plan and began running focus groups. They opened shortly after graduation.

“We developed the brand with best friends in mind, knowing that they had different budgets, different tastes and different sizes,” Ms. Staple said. Ms. Staple and Ms. Lamba knew, from experience, that brides wanted help in the planning process. But getting women together could be difficult since they’re often not in the same city, so they developed an online site to allow them, with stylists, to choose.

Brideside’s founders realized, however, that women still wanted to shop together. Like the men’s apparel brand Bonobos and the eyeglass purveyor Warby Parker, they chose to create a physical footprint by opening a few locations where bridal parties could try on the dresses. In November, Brideside opened its third location, this one in Manhattan.

While rents can be high, Ms. Staple says that by employing stylists who advise customers both online and in person, they avoid paying employees who might be idle when no customers are present. As a result of this approach, the physical locations have been a boon, not a drag, on earnings, she said, although she declined to disclose any financial results. The company, she said, plans on expanding in 2019 to offer bridal gowns as well.
