KABUL, Afghanistan — Five officials with Afghanistan’s soccer federation, including its leader, have been suspended indefinitely after allegations surfaced that some officials had sexually abused female players, Afghan officials said Sunday.

Jamshid Rasuli, the spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said the suspensions were ordered to prevent “violation of the investigative process,” although he did not explain what that meant. Those suspended included the Afghanistan Football Federation president, Keramuddin Keram, three other administrative officials and a coach in charge of goalies.

The suspensions came less than a week after the country’s president, Ashraf Ghani, ordered a prompt investigation into accusations, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that Mr. Keram, other federation officials and coaches had physically and sexually abused and even raped players on the national women’s team. Mr. Ghani called the revelations “shocking to all Afghans.”

The other suspended officials included the federation’s deputy president, Yosuf Kargar; its general secretary, Sayed Ali Reza Aghazada; a coach in charge of goalies, Abdul Saboor Walizada; and an official in charge of liaison with provincial football teams, Nadir Alimi, according to the attorney general’s office.
