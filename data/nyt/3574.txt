Born in Brooklyn, Ms. EL-Amin moved to North Carolina with her family when she was 6. In 2006, she returned to New York in search of new opportunities.

It was not an easy transition.

It took six months to find work as a billing clerk at a carpet and tile plant. That lasted a year before the company reduced its staff. She then worked for two years as a financial analyst at a Manhattan company before she was laid off. During some of those unsteady stretches, she slept on the floor of an aunt’s apartment.

Years later, she found herself heating her Brooklyn apartment with the stove and wondering how to get winter coats for two of her sons, then ages 7 and 8.

Her sons were attending the Gary Klinsky Children’s Center at Public School 149, run by Brooklyn Community Services, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
