We escaped to Margaritaville and made way for Glenda Jackson, got mad as hell all over again and learned to love a Malfoy. The year in theater had many riches and no shortage of surprise. Now that our chief critics have weighed in, it’s time for other New York Times writers and editors who spend lots of time in the dark to illuminate the moments that brought us joy and laughter, shock and awe. And the beat.

Grand entrance (1)

Any star gets entrance applause these days. Entrance yowls of terror? That’s trickier. But when the titular two-ton ape of “King Kong” — a marvel of puppetry, animatronics and some not exactly subtle sound, projection and lighting — blasted onto the Broadway stage, looking like he meant to eat the front mezzanine, it was a first impression for the ages.

Grand entrance (2)

Rarely has a strut so completely embodied a character as Taylor Louderman’s in “Mean Girls.” Playing queen bee Regina George, Ms. Louderman swings her hips with bold confidence and aligns each foot exactly ahead of the other, as if she were walking on a tightrope. It’s like watching the second coming of Ann-Margret, and it’s exhilarating. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI

An “Oklahoma!” with same-sex lovers might seem to have “gimmick” written all over it. But in Bill Rauch’s transformative and important production at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, any such worries melted away the instant that Curly (Tatiana Wechsler) made her exuberant entrance, as much fun to root for in romance as Ado Andy (Jonathan Luke Stevens) would turn out to be.
