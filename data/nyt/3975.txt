Familia, 29, did not come back for free, though. While he will earn less annually than standout closers on free-agent deals, he will be paid around the going rate for a top setup man. The same day Familia struck his deal, Joe Kelly, who is a year older than Familia and has less of a track record out of the bullpen, agreed to a three-year, $25 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers to be that team’s setup man.

Familia, though, wanted to return to the Mets so badly that when the off-season began he told his agent to explore any possibility of returning to Queens.

He had been through many ups and downs with the Mets. He signed with them for $100,000 at 17 out of his native Dominican Republic, using his earnings to build his family a home after a humble upbringing. He rose to become the team’s closer in 2015, blew three saves in that year’s World Series, then rebounded to make the All-Star team in 2016 while setting a franchise record with 51 saves. He started a family (his wife’s family lives in New Jersey), was suspended 15 games in 2017 for domestic violence accusations, and recovered from blood-clot surgery in his throwing shoulder.

In seven years as a Met, Familia amassed 123 saves and a 2.66 E.R.A.

“There a lot of people in our organization that are comfortable with him,” Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen said of Familia last week.

When the Mets traded Familia, he said it was tough because it was all so new, but he still called his time in Oakland, where he pitched mostly as a setup man, a good experience. Even then, however, he hoped to return to New York.
