ALBANY — Well, that escalated quickly.

Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat with a colorful reputation, casually tweeted at a Republican spokeswoman on Tuesday and told her to commit suicide.

He then deleted the Twitter post and apologized — only to come back at the spokeswoman less than an hour later, drawing calls for disciplinary action.

Given that it was Albany, of course, there were more than a few layers of back story, complete with barely buried feelings of party betrayal, memories of disastrous legislative sessions and the real possibility of parking placard impropriety.

It seemed to all begin on Tuesday with a Twitter post from Candice Giove, who works for the outgoing Republican majority leader, John J. Flanagan. Ms. Giove called attention to the possibly inappropriate use of Mr. Parker’s state-issued parking placard.
