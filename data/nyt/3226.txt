What were you thinking when you got dressed today?

Mostly, does this silhouette work? There are a lot of photos and you don’t know what angle they’re being taken from — not that I can dress a double chin. Black can be really severe, but I tried to keep the glam youthful.

Severe, but without being Darth Vader.

Or headmistress. With the hair back it was headmistress. The dress is Max Mara. The boots are Chloé.

Can I ask what the tattoo on your arm says?

It’s a Jenny Holzer quote. It says, “Words tend to be inadequate.” I regret getting a tattoo on my forearm, because people ask to read my arm. And I’m not someone who gets tattoos to show off. It was $80.
