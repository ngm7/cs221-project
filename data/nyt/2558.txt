Businesses, schools, and government buildings across the country were evacuated on Thursday in response to a wave of emailed bomb threats that the authorities said appeared to be a hoax.

The emails, which were received by hundreds of companies, hospitals, libraries and other institutions, according to the New York Police Department, were written in odd syntax and went something like this:

The sender claimed that an explosive device had been hidden “in the building where your company is conducted” and could be prevented from detonating with a $20,000 ransom payment, made using Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency.

In a version of the email published on Facebook by the police in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the sender promised to “call off my man if you make a transfer.”

While some people did not take the threat seriously, many others did, calling on law enforcement agencies and prompting evacuations.
