WASHINGTON — I’ll never forget the words I read scribbled on the wall when I was first put into a cage in a Cairo courtroom, on Feb. 26, 2012: “If defending justice is a crime, then long live criminality.”

That was the first day of my trial, Case No. 173/2011. (In Egyptian courtrooms, defendants are kept in cages.) Along with 42 other defendants, 17 of them Americans, who worked for international nongovernmental organizations in Egypt, I was charged with operating an organization without a license (not true) and receiving illegal foreign funds (also not true). All of us worked for organizations promoting the rule of law, transparency and democracy.

On June 4, 2013, we were found guilty and sentenced to one to five years in prison. The court claimed, with no legal evidence, that we were a threat to national security and were conspiring with foreign agents. But in February of this year, an appeal for a retrial was accepted and in November, it began. Now our ordeal is finally over. On Thursday, a court in Cairo acquitted us of all charges.

I am, of course, very happy to see our innocence finally, officially recognized. And more important, I hope that this news brings some needed optimism to Egyptian civil society groups, some of which are still being similarly prosecuted. But that doesn’t mean I am able to fully celebrate.
