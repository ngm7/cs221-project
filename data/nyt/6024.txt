To the Editor:

I must respectfully disagree with my friend John Barrasso ’s Op-Ed article (“Cut Carbon Through Innovation, Not Regulation,” nytimes.com, Dec. 18).

First, the referendum result in Washington State looked like more relentless campaigning by the fossil fuel industry against climate action; without that industry onslaught, the carbon tax referendum there would probably have passed.

Second, a carbon tax is not “expensive , ” except maybe for fossil fuel interests, as in our proposals all the money goes back to the public. In addition, taxing carbon moves energy markets toward cheaper renewables. On balance, people save money.

On top of that, the savings from avoiding climate catastrophes are immense. If you really want to innovate, there has to be a cost to carbon pollution. Without that, where is the incentive to innovate?
