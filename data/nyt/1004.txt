Tea Break | Monday, 10:30 a.m. Lucia Pica, Chanel’s global creative director for makeup and color, takes the morning to enjoy a bit of downtime at SoHo’s Cafe Gitane before diving into preparations for the brand’s Metiers d’Art show, which will take place the next evening. She arrived from London two days before to ensure enough time to settle in, catch up with a few friends over dinner at Frenchette and even drop in for a Sunday afternoon yoga class.
