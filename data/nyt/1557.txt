Re “He Died Evangelizing. Some Call Him Reckless, Others a Martyr” (news article, Dec. 3):

The people of North Sentinel Island have a right to live their lives, as they have for tens of thousands of years, without intrusion. Advocates for evangelical action, whatever their beliefs, should have the humility to acknowledge that they do not know everything. Not knowing everything they should admit the possibility that they are wrong in trying to impose their beliefs on others.

If there is a Supreme Being, it is possible that it sees the people of North Sentinel Island as every bit as worthy as any others and therefore without the need for missionary ministrations.

Re “Should We Contact Isolated Tribes?,” by Jeffrey Gettleman (Sunday Review, Dec. 2):

The answer to the headline’s question is: No. The people in the tribe living on North Sentinel Island cannot make it any clearer that they do not want contact with the outside world. Why is it so hard for us to hear them? Why do we consider it negotiable?

It is not for us to second-guess them by saying, wait a minute don’t you want a cellphone, or to inflict colonialism on them for their “own good” and our rapacious greed for beautiful land and whatever other resources their island contains. Our insistence on bothering them is dangerous to their physical, mental and cultural health.
