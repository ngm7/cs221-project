SYDNEY, Australia — The Facebook group was supposed to be a fun distraction from high school exams.

Its creators, a crew of Melbourne students who had bonded over weekends in Chinese language school, had noticed a Facebook group called “Subtle Private School Traits.”

They started joking about their own experiences: the struggles and joys of being a first-generation immigrant.

“We were like, what if we made a ‘Subtle Asian Traits’ page,” said Anne Gu, 18.

The concept was simple: Share jokes about the traits, subtle or otherwise, that characterized the Asian-Australian experience, from cultural clashes with parents and the sanctity of bubble milk tea, to the groan-worthy pickup lines from white men on dating apps. (Are you from Asia? Because I’m China get your number.)

In September, they created a Facebook group and added their friends, expecting it would live and die within the young, Asian community in Melbourne.
