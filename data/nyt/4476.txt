You may not have known, but in a few days you were going to have to pay an extra $2.50 or $2.75 every time you hopped in a taxi or an Uber in Manhattan south of 96th Street.

The extra charge was going to take effect Jan. 1, and it may still come at some point, but on Thursday, a judge put it on hold.

The Times’s Winnie Hu explains:

The surcharge is $2.75 for Ubers and Lyfts; $2.50 for yellow taxis; and 75 cents for car pool services like Via and UberPool. It was imposed by the state to raise money, mainly to fix the ailing subways.

Hit the brakes: A coalition of taxi drivers and owners filed suit to overturn the surcharge, saying that yellow cabs should be exempted. They say the congestion this “congestion pricing” surcharge is addressing is not their fault since their numbers are capped (at 13,587 cabs).

In a last-minute reprieve, a state-court judge temporarily blocked the new surcharge and ordered a hearing for Jan. 3.
