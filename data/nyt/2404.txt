After spending days trapped in an abandoned coal mine in West Virginia, three people were found and rescued on Wednesday evening, the authorities said.

Rescue workers had been searching for the people since early Sunday, after an all-terrain vehicle was found outside the inactive Rock House Powellton mine near the small community of Clear Creek, about 30 miles southeast of Charleston, W.Va.

At first, four people were trapped inside. But one of them, Eddie Williams, managed to get out on Monday and told the authorities that Kayla Williams, 25, Erica Treadway, 31, and Cody Beverly, 21, were still inside.

“Many prayers were answered when the one individual exited the mine with information about where the others were located,” Gov. Jim Justice said in a statement at the time.
