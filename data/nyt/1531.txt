Challenge Yahya Abdul-Mateen II to a staring contest and he’ll almost certainly win. Chess, on the other hand? The verdict is still out.

He was partaking in both on a recent Sunday morning in Union Square Park in Manhattan, where he was playing chess against Douglas Miller, a chess teacher recommended by a friend.

Mr. Abdul-Mateen leaned forward and fixed his opponent with a penetrating gaze, but it made little difference. In a spirited but silent exchange, he quickly lost a rook after moving a pawn forward without anticipating the opening.

He rubbed his mustache and sighed. “I should’ve seen that,” he said, whispering to himself.

His chess skills may need work, but his acting career is doing just fine, thank you. In a short amount of time, Mr. Abdul-Mateen, 32, has made his mark as a charismatic actor, most notably in “The Get Down,” a 2016 Netflix series directed by Baz Luhrmann in which he played a disco-dancing gangster named Cadillac. And this month he will star in “Aquaman,” opposite Jason Momoa, as the superhero’s archnemesis, Black Manta.
