London’s Covent Garden district is not short of restaurants. Lots of them are links in British and international chains (anyone for Shake Shack?), but there are plenty of excellent independents too.

One of the newest is Cora Pearl, named after a woman whose dates were 1835-86 and whose occupation Wikipedia gives as “courtesan.” A sister restaurant, Kitty Fisher, also takes its name from a scandalous woman, albeit one who had her portrait painted by Joshua Reynolds. Evidently, this is meant to evoke the high life of ages past.

But apart from some Beardsley-esque artwork there’s little about the restaurant that’s backward-looking. The food of head chef George Barson is of the moment, with appealing seasonal dishes that sometimes turn out to be more complex than they sound, but with no fuss or flash. “Pork & Turnips,” for instance, is presa — a cut from the shoulder of Ibérico hogs — grilled to a precise medium-rare; it’s dense and tender, smoky and juicy, with a big, meaty flavor we don’t always associate with pork. But the turnips are what keep the kitchen busy. Some are pickled, some mashed, some cut into wedges and grilled. Mr. Barson said that the vegetable will change with the seasons; this turnip version, served at an early-October dinner, will be hard to top.

“Cod & Spiced Crab” also sounds straightforward, yet the briefly cured cod is finished with curry butter, topped with crab meat bathed in spicy hollandaise, and accompanied by several preparations of cauliflower.
