Franklin made superstardom look effortless, even as she raced in a 200-meter freestyle and a 100-meter backstroke 14 minutes apart at the London Olympics. But that kind of fame and excellences comes at a price.

Franklin, a self-described pleaser, opened up after the 2016 Olympics about her struggles with anxiety, depression and disordered eating — problems that were perhaps inevitable for someone wired not to disappoint people as she repeatedly interacted with fans, sponsors and swimming officials pining for the return of the indestructible “Missy the Missile.”

In the winter of 2016, over dinner in suburban Denver, where she grew up, Franklin told me about a chance encounter over the holidays. While shopping with her father, she bumped into the parent of a young woman she used to race against. She stopped to say hello and the man told Franklin that everyone was rooting for her. Knowing that she had slowed down a bit, he added that they were all praying that she would return to form in time for the 2016 Olympics. Franklin remembered thinking, “Was that meant to be a compliment?”

She laughed, but at that moment the price of being America’s chlorine queen seemed exorbitant. Her farewell letter provided proof that even as many openly yearned for Franklin to reclaim her past glory, she was continuing to grow in ways that no timing system could measure.
