The holidays are here, and so are the annual holiday culture wars.

It’s a time of year when people gather with their loved ones, engage in a little good cheer, and grin (or cringe) their way through their favorite songs or movies, even the ones that may not have aged so well. So tell us: how do you do it?

These debates are relevant year-round — Do you still watch reruns of “The Cosby Show”? What about a film produced by Harvey Weinstein? — but they are supercharged by the collision of the #MeToo movement and the hidebound traditions of the holiday season.

Maybe you hum along to “Baby It’s Cold Outside,” despite the murky and much-debated power dynamic between the duet partners. Does the woman in that song actually want to stay? And, hey, what is in her drink?

Do you watch “Love, Actually,” even though when you stop and think about it, some of its romantic subplots involve what might be considered workplace sexual harassment? Or “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” which appeared in a HuffPost video that satirized its portrayal of bullying and was nonetheless taken seriously by some?
