PITTSBURGH — The soaring if habitually overlooked Los Angeles Chargers came to Pittsburgh on Sunday night to prove that the A.F.C. power structure had shifted, perhaps even farther west than the home of the red-hot Kansas City Chiefs.

With the N.F.L. regular season entering the final month, it was a game to certify which team might best challenge the ascendant Chiefs and the reigning New England Patriots for the A.F.C. championship.

And in a quirky, entertaining game that did not end until there were three successive tries at a last-second winning field goal, the Chargers made their case, rallying from 16 points down late in the third quarter for a stirring 33-30 victory.

“We said we were going to come in and take what we wanted,” Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen said in a rambunctious visiting locker room. “And that’s what we did. We stuck together, got a road win in a tough place and did it on national TV.”
