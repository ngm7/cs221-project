There is no data that suggests a white-noise machine alters the frequencies of the brain, said Param Dedhia, the director of sleep medicine at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson. “But we can show that if you make a loud sound, you can affect your response to that with a noise machine. It’s called auditory masking.”

Dr. Dedhia described its effects as a sound bubble, “a force field of sound such that a noise has to be much stronger to break through.” Dr. Dedhia has deployed Marpac Dohms in the bedrooms at Canyon Ranch, and also in his home, because the pool there draws an army of bullfrogs after dark. Their nightly chorus drives him bananas.

“Oh, my friend,” he said, “it sounds like someone dying. I used to get my hose and spray them off the sides of the pool, but they soon were on to me, and after a while just hopped back on. So now I have my humidifier running, and the white noise right next to the bed. It’s my sound bubble. We don’t have to have a bug or pill for every ill if we can soothe ourselves. It’s a skill, it really is. If we could all self-soothe, it would make it easier to handle other chaos.”

What is noise, anyway? Dr. Dedhia likes this definition, from the authors of a sleep study: “Noise is defined as unwanted sounds that could have negative psychological and physiological effects.”

Noise is terribly subjective. There are those who love the croak of a bullfrog, and are soothed by the snores of their partner because it means they are close. Dr. Pigeon allowed that snoring was particularly tough to mask, given its locality (next to your head) and unpredictability (your ears crane for the next growl or explosive sigh).

“You must convince yourself the sound of snoring is beautiful,” he said. “I have some people who asked me to put snoring on the website because they are used to sleeping with a partner snoring, and when that partner is gone — traveling or divorced or dead — they miss that sound.”
