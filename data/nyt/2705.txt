A contractor working at Bloomberg company offices in Manhattan sent a text to an executive who helped oversee the work, asking a seemingly innocuous question: “How was the sandwich?”

But this was not a query about lunch, according to indictments unsealed Tuesday in State Supreme Court. The papers described a wide-ranging scheme involving three companies to steal at least $15 million from Bloomberg L.P., the giant financial information and media company, through bribes, kickbacks and bid rigging.

Among the conspirators, “sandwich” was code for bribes or kickbacks, prosecutors said. The contractor wanted to know if the executive, Vito Nigro of Turner Construction, was satisfied with the thick envelope stuffed with cash that had been delivered to his office the prior day, according to the indictment.

Mr. Nigro and the contractor were among the 14 people charged with grand larceny, bribetaking, bid rigging, money laundering and falsifying business records relating to work at Bloomberg offices at 120 Park Avenue and 919 Third Avenue. The defendants all pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and were released on bail. Three companies were also charged in the scheme and pleaded not guilty.
