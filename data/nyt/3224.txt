To the Editor:

I went to bed in 2018 and woke up in 1975, the year I graduated from college. At that point I was told I should not be admitted to architecture school because I “would just have babies and waste the opportunity some man could use.”

Now, two of the most powerful women on the world stage, Nancy Pelosi and Theresa May, have been forced to agree to an end date of their role in government in order to keep their positions during times of great stress (“May Retains Post, but E.U. Exit Plan Faces Bleak Path,” front page, Dec. 13, and “Pelosi Accepts Limit on Her Tenure as Speaker,” front page, Dec. 13).

I do not remember a single male politician who was forced to compromise on the length of his service. The world may have changed for women, but not enough.
