In “Nixon Agonistes” (1970), his matchless book of reportage and analysis, Garry Wills explored why Richard Nixon succeeded while smarter and more charismatic politicians did not. Among Wills’s conclusions: Nixon had what peers called an “iron butt,” a willingness to sit and study harder than everyone else.

As a book critic, I’ve sometimes been inordinately proud of my own iron butt. I may not be able to read faster than you can, I have thought to myself, observing others in public libraries and coffee shops, but I’ll bet I can read longer.

Five months ago I was shopping for trousers in the Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue when I caught sight of my backside in one of those 360-degree mirrors. “Iron” was hardly the word that came to mind. I decided to start exercising.

This is prelude to saying that Peter Sagal’s “The Incomplete Book of Running” fell onto my doorstep at almost exactly the moment I began to go for painful, mist-sucking, aesthetically disastrous but oddly satisfying runs along the Hudson River.
