‘Bring It On’

Starts streaming: Jan. 2

Netflix is adding “Bring It On” and four of the film’s five direct-to-video sequels — whither “Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack”? — but the original 2000 comedy remains the only necessary viewing in this cheer-i-verse. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku play off each other beautifully as mismatched cheerleaders trying to lead their squad back to competition glory, and the director Peyton Reed scores laughs at the absurdities of the sport, especially in a sequence in which a choreographer introduces the girls to “spirit fingers.” “Bring It On” also squeezes in a substantive critique of cultural appropriation, turning on a routine stolen from a mostly black squad from Compton.

‘The Bourne Ultimatum’

Starts streaming: Jan. 2

On the same day Netflix is making nearly all the “Bring It On” movies available, the service is also releasing four of the five Jason Bourne movies, which are much more bingeworthy. (Missing is the most recent entry, “Jason Bourne.”) The Bourne series has positioned itself as a more with-it James Bond, stripping away the glamour and camp of 007 in favor of a grittier engagement with today’s threats of mass surveillance and stateless violence. “The Bourne Ultimatum,” the third and best of the series, follows Bourne (Matt Damon) as he discovers a secret C.I.A. black-ops mission to use agents like himself to carry out assassinations.

‘Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened’

Starts streaming: Jan. 18

Promoted as a high-end musical event, the inaugural Fyre Festival was scheduled over two weekends on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma, where attendees would indulge in modern food and luxury beachside geodesic domes while enjoying performances by the headliner and co-founder, Ja Rule, and other guests. Then on opening weekend in late April 2017, reports started flooding social media of missing luggage, a tent city with dirt floors, sandwiches of white bread and processed cheese, and an absence of staff on the scene. The botched festival and its fallout — which landed the organizer Billy McFarland a six-year prison sentence and a $26 million fine for wire fraud — are covered in this hotly anticipated documentary by Chris Smith, the director of “American Movie.”

‘Girl’

Starts streaming: Jan. 18

This Belgian drama about a transgender girl (Victor Polster) who wants to be a ballerina was praised as a powerful coming-of-age story and won the Camera d’Or for best first feature at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it picked up mostly rave reviews. The film has since drawn heavy criticism from trans and queer writers who objected to its treatment of the subject, noting the absence of trans participants on either side of the camera, as well as its treatment of hormone replacement therapy. “Girl” and the controversy surrounding it will reach a wider audience with its Netflix premiere.

‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’

Starts streaming: Jan. 29

Ant-Man is the Marvel superhero for those who have a more casual relationship to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — or perhaps a more whimsical conception of what a superhero should be. The first “Ant-Man” reflected some of the disarray behind the scenes: The film started with the director Edgar Wright and ended with the director Peyton Reed co-authoring a rewrite and hustling the film to production. “Ant-Man and the Wasp” is more confident and more fun than its predecessor, with Paul Rudd reprising his role as the wisecracking, diminutive super-dad and teaming up with Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp for a quantum-level adventure. Though Ant-Man didn’t appear in the most recent “Avengers” movie, his connection to the MCU leads to one of Marvel’s better post-credits sequences.
