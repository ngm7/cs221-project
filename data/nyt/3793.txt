Justin and Crystal Reynolds shared their first dance as husband and wife almost three years ago surrounded by friends, family, manta rays and whale sharks. They married submerged in 6.3 million gallons of water inside the Ocean Voyager exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.

“We definitely wanted to mix our wedding with diving because it was something we were so passionate about,” said Ms. Reynolds, 33, who lives in Weston, Fla., and is studying criminal justice and forensic psychology at Purdue University Global.

In preparation, the bridesmaid, groomsman and officiant achieved scuba certification. “Everyone had to wear a dive suit, and then, over the dive suit, we wore our wedding attire,” said Ms. Reynolds, who chose a lace gown. “My dress and my veil were weighted to keep them from flowing in the water.”
