The Los Angeles Rams have M.V.P. candidates in Jared Goff and Todd Gurley, with the pair combining to power the N.F.L.â€™s No. 2 offense this season. On Sunday night, those stars combined for one fewer touchdown than Bradley Sowell, an offensive tackle for the Chicago Bears.

That shocking statistic is made no less strange by the fact that the 2-yard touchdown pass from Mitchell Trubisky to Sowell was set up by a play-action fake to Akiem Hicks, a 330-pound defensive lineman, on a play in which Chicago had sent several members of its defense onto the field for what looked like a goal-line rush.

Such was life in one of the stranger meetings of top teams in recent N.F.L. history. The Bears, finally back at full strength with Trubisky under center, showed that their defense can slow down absolutely any team. And the Rams, who had come into the game with an N.F.L.-best record of 11-1, left Soldier Field trying to figure out what went wrong. It all added up to a 15-6 victory for Chicago.
