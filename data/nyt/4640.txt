The Nasdaq is close to bear territory

Stocks tumbled yet again on Thursday, taking the continuing sell-off to new depths.

The Nasdaq is now almost in a bear market. The tech-heavy index fell 1.6 percent yesterday, pushing it 19.5 percent below its late-August peak. (A fall of 20 percent puts it in bear territory.) The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent, and is down more than 15 percent from its peak.

What they’re saying. “There’s just a constant selling pressure,” Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, a financial market research firm in Harrison, N.Y., told the NYT. “It’s just any excuse is an excuse to sell.”

And there’s a long list of excuses to pick from. Here are several worth singling out: New U.S.-China tensions after a fresh batch of hacking indictments (more on that below); a malaise over the Fed’s rate increases; technology stocks falling out of favor; the threat of a government shutdown; and the persistent slump in oil prices.
