Japan took a step on Tuesday toward expanding its military capabilities by advancing plans for aircraft carriers that can launch fighter jets.

The plans, contained in a draft of new defense guidelines approved by the governing parties, would effectively arm Japan with its first aircraft carriers since World War II, with potential striking powers well beyond Japanese territory.

The move risks inflaming a politically delicate debate in Japan over whether such expanded military capability is compatible with the countryâ€™s pacifist constitution. The plans could be construed as offensive weapons beyond those deemed necessary for self-defense.

Under the change, large Japanese naval vessels now equipped with helicopters would be upgraded, enabling them to carry jet fighters capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings, and equipped with stealth technology to avoid detection.
