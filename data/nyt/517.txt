On Nov. 13, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, met with several female journalists and activists in New Delhi to talk about online safety in India. Female journalists and activists from religious and cultural minorities face relentless harassment and abuse on Mr. Dorsey’s platform. The meeting with Mr. Dorsey and other Twitter executives was aimed at helping them better understand the magnitude of the problem in India.

My colleague Sanghapali Aruna, who runs Project Mukti, an organization that leverages technology to empower Dalits to fight caste prejudice, was among the attendees. “Dalit,” which means “oppressed,” refers to the caste of people who suffer the greatest violence, discrimination and disenfranchisement under India’s caste apartheid that structures Hindu society.

When Ms. Aruna met Mr. Dorsey she had already left the platform, fearing for her safety following a Twitter doxxing incident after which she was confronted and threatened. As she shared her experiences of discrimination and intimidation on Twitter, Vijaya Gadde, the company’s head of legal, policy, trust and safety, openly wept. Dalits and another Indian minorities are regularly harassed on, if not forced off, Twitter by right-wing troll armies.

Twitter’s position as a platform for political discourse in India was cemented after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party famously used social media during his campaign in the 2014 national elections. Since Mr. Modi came to power, his followers have been conveying positive messages about his government, often using doctored images.
