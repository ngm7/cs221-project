Voting him out would require a unanimous decision from the seven members, or a majority of the 10-member player council, led by top-ranked Novak Djokovic.

Isner is also a member of the player council and, according to ESPN, he stood by Gimelstob on a recent conference call.

“We’ll know the facts soon enough,” said Isner, 33, who this year achieved his highest career ranking, No. 8, and reached his first Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon. “It might not be a popular opinion, but as of now, I have to give Justin benefit of doubt.”

Tennis Channel, which is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, has also said it will monitor events in the court case. The network said it granted a request from Gimelstob to step aside from his job as a broadcaster during the legal process. Tennis is currently in its off-season, so no tournaments are being played. The new season begins at the end of the month.

“Justin asked Tennis Channel for a leave of absence while he works through this issue,” the network said in a statement. “As he is a longtime, valued member of our network family, we of course granted it to him. We believe that in today’s climate, perhaps more than ever, it’s important to recognize due process and the fact that there are multiple sides to every story. We don’t want to rush to immediate judgment, and will follow this closely as more detail comes to light.”

Before the Oct. 31 incident, Gimelstob, a prominent and exuberant presence at Isner’s matches, had said that he intended to reduce his workload in tennis to spend more time with his 5-year-old son, Brandon.
