In other words, the strength of Democratic victories in November has raised the paradoxical possibility of more headaches for the state’s Democratic governor than he endured from Republicans.

“I think that as a new senator, I’m less concerned about managing expectations,” said Julia Salazar, one of the six victorious insurgents who also panned the governor’s education remarks. “And a little bit, given my position on the political spectrum, I’m less concerned about my direct relationship with Governor Cuomo.”

Mr. Cuomo’s office pushes back on any assertion that it has shortchanged education, noting that spending has increased 36 percent since 2012, including a $1 billion increase this year, to a record high: $26.7 billion. And there is no doubt that during his two terms in office, the governor has forged a reputation as a master tactician who dominates all major negotiations, putting his political weight behind issues such as same-sex marriage or gun restrictions, and winning victories despite daunting odds.

But legislation he dislikes often languishes, and open criticism of him from fellow Democrats is rare.

Progressives have long worried that Mr. Cuomo was using his political acumen to secretly undermine the liberal agenda he promoted, in particular by tacitly accepting the decision of a group of Democratic senators, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, to collaborate with the Republicans. Until recently, those senators helped allow Republicans to maintain control of the chamber and stall expensive bills that Mr. Cuomo, a fiscal moderate, might have wanted to avoid.

Mr. Cuomo, progressives said, could then blame the Senate Republicans rather than having to veto the bills himself. He also blamed the Republicans for blocking some progressive legislation, such as the Dream Act, which would have made it possible for undocumented students to receive state financial aid.
