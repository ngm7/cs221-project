Dorrance Dance — the company led by Michelle Dorrance, the most prominent and ubiquitous tap dancer today — made its first appearance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday. True to form, the troupe treated the theater (the small, adaptable BAM Fisher) as a musical instrument.

The show is called “Elemental” for good reason, but the first principle it establishes is elementary: This company of mostly tap dancers is its own band of musicians. Keyboard and bass might help establish a song (“All the Things You Are” to start), yet it’s the dancers who carry it, snapping their fingers and scatting the melody in time with their taps, their mouths clarifying what their feet are doing: singing the song.
