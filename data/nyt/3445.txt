The hush-money investigation advances

On Wednesday, in a major step in the investigation of hush-money payments made to two women who said that they had affairs with President Trump, the parent company of The National Enquirer admitted to paying off a Playboy model to protect Mr. Trump’s campaign. The tabloid played a crucial role in keeping the women silent ahead of the 2016 election.

The revelations came on the same day that Michael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump who directly implicated the president in the hush-money scandal during his sentencing, received three years in prison.

Mr. Trump reacted angrily to the relatively short prison sentence of Mr. Cohen, and in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday said that Mr. Cohen failed him as his lawyer because he should have known about campaign finance law. The president also said that he did not direct his lawyer to do anything illegal. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, Mr. Cohen said that “of course” the president knew the hush payments were wrong.
