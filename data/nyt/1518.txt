Avenatti became famous as Stormy Daniels’s lawyer, a kind of high-end version of the reindeer-lawn strategy. He made campaign visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, which created quite a bit of buzz. Perhaps he lost interest when it became clear that while many people wanted to get a look at him, nobody actually wanted to vote for him.

Or maybe it was Avenatti’s recent arrest on domestic violence charges. Or his law firm’s eviction from its offices for nonpayment of rent. Anyhow, he withdrew, citing family considerations.

Former governor Patrick, who is a popular member of the Obama crowd, really did have family considerations And to be fair, he never said he was running in the first place. But he was talked about. That’s more than you can say for Representative John Delaney of Maryland, who has already been out campaigning for president for more than a year. The man has been to all 99 counties in Iowa, and admit it — you don’t even know who he is.

Patrick’s farewell means that when it comes to presidential prospects, the state that gave us John Kennedy is pretty much down to two senators plus John (“not taking anything off the table”) Kerry. Plus nine House members including Joe (“I have no plans”) Kennedy III.

Look around the country — the possibilities are endless. There are 47 Democratic Senators, most of whom, I guarantee you, are at least daydreaming. And next year there will be at least 234 Democrats in the House of Representatives, all walking around looking available. If you run into one, try to avoid mentioning that we haven’t elected a House member president since James Garfield.
