“Be good or be gone” has long been the slogan of the Apollo Theater’s Amateur Night, an open-mic talent show where the audience can boo lackluster performers off the stage. Joe Gray has done the warm-ups for the past 30 years, getting the crowd fired up before the first contestant goes on.

After he turned 69 in June, he decided it was time for him to be gone: It was time to retire. The search for a replacement began. In September, a casting agency held auditions.

Then Mr. Gray changed his mind. He decided that not working — not bantering with the audience, and not hanging out with performers and stagehands behind the scenes — was not for him.

He was on the way to work one day in the fall when he started thinking about his path toward retirement. “I said, ‘I still have love for this place and I am feeling good, except for my knees,” he recalled, explaining that he had surgery to fix tears in both menisci several years ago. One had popped while he was onstage.
