Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times.

Gertrude Beasley begins her 1925 scathing memoir of growing up in rural Texas like this:

“Thirty years ago, I lay in the womb of a woman, conceived in a sexual act of rape, being carried during the prenatal period by an unwilling and rebellious mother, finally bursting from the womb only to be tormented in a family whose members I despised or pitied, and brought into association with people whom I should never have chosen.”

The book, “My First Thirty Years,” goes on:

“Sometimes I wish that, as I lay in the womb, a pink soft embryo, I had somehow thought, breathed or moved and wrought destruction to the woman who bore me, and her eight miserable children who preceded me, and the four round-faced mediocrities who came after me, and her husband, a monstrously cruel, Christ-like, and handsome man with an animal’s appetite for begetting children.”

On the second page, Beasley says that when she was between the ages of 4 and 9, each of her five older brothers tried to have sex with her. She also recounts the time one of her brothers was caught doing something indecent with the family cow.
