Bringing home a new pet is a big event for both a new pet owner, and the pet. Making sure youâ€™re prepared in advance can make the change easier on everyone, and that includes buying the right gear, and reading up on what a new pet needs.

Wirecutter has plenty of advice on where to start with a new cat or new dog, and Kaitlyn Wells, Wirecutter staff writer and pets expert, has tested dozens of toys, tools, and accessories with the help of her 9-year-old cat and 1-year-old dog.
