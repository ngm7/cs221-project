Definitely freeing. She’s a dangerous person. A lot of times, I would let out a huge yell or a growl before I would start, which I know sounds insane.

Well, she’s a very primal character. What was it like to live inside that for the shoot?

It gets you down, carrying the weight of her, because it also has to be real. But there was something amazing about being able to let that energy out. I’ve never done that before in a film. There’s a scene where I go in and beat up my daughter’s boyfriend, and it was the second or third day of shooting. I said to the guy, “Listen, just watch out.” He said, “No, I can take it.” And I just went there and start pushing him, like whoa! I was angry, really angry.

I don’t think you’ve ever played a character this aggressive before.

Yeah, and I could tell by the way people reacted on the set. Everyone steered clear of me, but I was taught very early on by Jane Campion, who said to me, “You’re not running for ‘most popular’ when you’re an actor, remember that. You have to be true to the essence of the character.” You can be decent to people and show your respect to them, but the idea of flitting around and joking, you can’t be doing any of that. Otherwise, it would have felt like I was acting.

The movie cuts between a young Erin and the wrecked, older version. With the aid of makeup and special effects, you play both.

Normally, they’d cast a younger actress, but that would have been a dealbreaker for me. I’m not going to do a character where I can’t play the whole arc of her — it would be unbelievably frustrating. One of the interesting things about Erin is that when she finds out she’s pregnant, she’s high — and that’s the relationship she starts with her child. That’s fascinating and riddled with pain, and if I can’t play that scene and both sides of this character, that’s just not interesting to me at this stage.
