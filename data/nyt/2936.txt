As Eliot Orton, who, with his siblings, runs the family company, tells the story, a number of customers years ago wrote in requesting ceramic Christmas trees, so the company found an original mold and began reproducing them. Theirs, unlike most new ones, have removable bulbs like the originals did. “What we try to do is create something that’s authentic,” he said.

It’s not just trees that are hot this year but all manner of holiday ceramics, Mr. Orton said. Flying Angel Candle Huggers, anyone? He’s got them. “It’s great to get that little thing that’s going to offer some delight in our customers’ lives and bring some magic into their homes at Christmastime,” he said. His company’s 13-inch trees cost about $40. Bulbs shaped like birds or holly leaves are available. Candle huggers? About 30 bucks, matching candle holders included.

Those customers who must have a vintage ceramic Christmas tree can expect to spend more, unless they get lucky at a thrift shop or an estate sale. In antique stores, original ones can fetch $75 or more, said Kristopher Kyer, an actor and former circus ringmaster who runs a seasonal boutique called Kristopher Kyer’s Christmas Corner in Burbank, Calif.

Mr. Kyer’s “museum of vintage Christmas” carries only evergreens made by crafty hands back in the day. “These are homegrown trees,” he said, adding that the old ones have a timeworn patina that the brightly colored new models lack.

Unconcerned with the prices, some customers have amassed extensive collections of ceramic Christmas trees that they display every year, he noted. “There are people who have tons of them. When they see one they don’t have, there’s a gasp,” Mr. Kyer said, adding “It’s a sickness, but isn’t it wonderful?”
