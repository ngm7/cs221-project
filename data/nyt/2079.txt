Two of the highest ranking United States Olympic officials did nothing to investigate, report, or stop Larry Nassar, the longtime gymnastics national team doctor, after learning that he had been accused of sexual abuse, according to a searing report released Monday.

Scott Blackmun, the committee’s former chief executive, and Alan Ashley, its chief of sport performance, knew of accusations against Nassar more than a year before they became public knowledge in September 2016, according to a 233-page report put together by the law firm Ropes & Gray at the committee’s request. Ashley, who joined the U.S.O.C. in 2006, was fired after the report was released on Monday.

The report sought to determine who at the U.S.O.C. and U.S.A. Gymnastics knew what, and when, about Nassar’s serial abuse, and investigators found what they described as “an ecosystem that facilitated his criminal acts” — including failures by U.S.O.C. officials that one United States senator said warrant a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice.

Nassar, who has been accused of sexually abusing hundreds of girls and women, is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison after being convicted of criminal sexual conduct. Dozens of the girls and women said they were molested after the U.S.O.C. had been informed of the accusations but before they became public.
