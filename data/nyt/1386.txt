Any documentary — or obituary — that reckons with the legacy of Roger E. Ailes faces an almost impossible choice of emphasis.

Here, after all, was a gifted news media pioneer who served as a presidential campaign whisperer to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump. As the longtime chief executive of and main creative force behind Fox News, Ailes can be credited not only with changing the nature of political discourse in this country, but also with making a large number of Americans, left and right, significantly angrier. And his career ended after a surge of sexual-harassment allegations and accusations that he had fostered a misogynistic boy’s-club culture at Fox News — a scandal that forced him from the channel in 2016, a little less than a year before his death.

“Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes,” a documentary from Alexis Bloom (“Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds”), may disappoint those looking for different inflections, but it does an impressive and absorbing job of covering all those bases. What’s more, it conveys a credible sense of Ailes’s psychology through the testimony of peers and co-workers who witnessed his ruthlessness firsthand.
