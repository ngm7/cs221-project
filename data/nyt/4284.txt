In “The Brain Fog of Menopause Can Burn Off,” by Jane E. Brody (Personal Health column, Dec. 18):

Menopause-related cognitive impairment does indeed affect about 60 percent of women, and it is true that the diagnosis is often missed and that this “brain fog” responds, often dramatically, to hormone replacement therapy.

But for most women it is sadly not the case that “this too shall pass.” Rates of cognitive impairment and dementia are rising, and the risks of Alzheimer’s are far greater for women than for men. Ms. Brody cites the gerontologist Dr. Gail A. Greendale in support of the idea that menopausal brain fog will fade away, but Dr. Greendale has written that the long-term cognitive consequences that often begin during perimenopause may stem directly from the decline in estrogen .

We have reviewed decades of evidence from animal and human studies, across many different empirical methods, suggesting that when women begin taking hormone replacement therapy during menopause their risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in later years drops sharply, by 35 to 70 percent.

There is no other intervention that comes close to that success rate. Not exercise, not diet, not even doing the Times crossword.
