A man was arrested at the Denver Art Museum this weekend after he pushed over an exhibition case and hurled works of art to the floor, damaging rare Mayan artifacts and a Qing dynasty Chinese vase, according to the Denver police.

The man, Jake Siebenlist, 18, was charged with criminal mischief on Sunday. The vandalism began when Mr. Siebenlist shoved patrons aside and, as he was being pursued, grabbed sculptures that he threw across the gallery and smashed to the floor, the police said. He also tried to damage two paintings enclosed in protective plastic before museum officials tackled him to the ground, according to the police.

At a news conference on Monday, museum officials could not explain Mr. Siebenlist’s actions. “If you destroy artwork in a gallery, that is, to begin with, pretty weird,” said Christoph Heinrich, the director of the museum. “And he was very aggravated and, obviously, not in a state of mind that was reasonable.”

In all, 10 works were damaged, including the Chinese vase with phoenixes, a Mayan vessel shaped like a fish, and a wolf mask and headdress. The value of the objects was not disclosed. They were part of a new exhibition, “Stampede: Animals in Art,” a more than 300-piece show on display until May that highlights artwork from the museum’s collection.
