Catch up: In May, The New York Times ran a series called “Unsheltered” (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3) that examined why many rent-regulated apartments disappear every year.

The victims: Practically everybody. The Times reporter Grace Ashford, who worked on the series, told me, “Rising rents affect all New Yorkers — when low-income families are pushed out of the only apartments they can afford so that they can be gutted and re-rented for $3,000, nobody wins.”
