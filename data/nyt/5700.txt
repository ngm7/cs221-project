Dining

Topside, the top floor bar and restaurant, with its glass walls giving a panoramic view of the city below, is a popular draw for locals and guests alike. On a recent Saturday evening, the bar was packed and every table had been booked for dinner . (Reservations are essential on the weekends.) One draw seems to be the extensive list of specialty cocktails and 13 offerings of locally brewed draft beer. Dining options ranged from striped bass yakitori ($14) to braised rabbit with butter beans, bacon, kale and apples ($29). In the morning, the room service menu was limited to just four choices (among them almond milk oatmeal and eggs with homemade sausage) so I decided to go down to the Square Meal, the ground floor “farm-inspired” restaurant. The room resembled an upscale college cafeteria (you had to line up at the counter to place your order) and the menu was basically the same as the one in my room, with the notable addition of some freshly baked muffins. But my breakfast — I went with the eggs and sausage ($13) — arrived 11 minutes after I ordered and was quite tasty. The orange juice was fresh; the flat white coffee expertly prepared. And it turned out I had made the right call. As I was paying my bill, another guest arrived and said he wanted to place a room service order. “No problem,” the hostess replied, “but you know, you could have used the phone in your room to call us.” “I did,” he replied. “No one ever picked up.”
