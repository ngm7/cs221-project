Yet the ardent title refers as much to things you can’t physically grasp — movement, light, sound — and to the possibility of being fully present, as a viewer, in the moment. Mr. Greenberg, who has been making dances for more than three decades, allows us to do just that, creating a world that’s difficult to explain but easy to enjoy, a series of moments to get lost in.

In his brief solo, Mr. Greenberg establishes the dreamy structure — and the subtly madcap humor — that persists through the work’s 75 minutes. Wearing a green track suit (Paige Martin and Parker Lutz designed the fashionably sporty costumes) and wielding a wooden pole, he could be part of a baseball team or a marching band, yet these associations linger for just seconds before transforming. Michael Stiller’s pliant lighting and James Lo’s playful soundscape — sampling from Prokofiev, Ruth Draper monologues and the soundtrack to “La Dolce Vita,” among other sources — also shift abruptly, as if sweeping us through portals, between dimensions.

It’s the three other dancers who commune most intimately with the theater, getting close to its architecture as they hold microphones to its worn walls (so much history in there), recline against its radiators and make a racket banging on the floor. Mr. Greenberg credits them with generating the movement, through improvisations recorded on video, then copied verbatim; that process comes through in their comfort with the material and the pleasure it appears to bring them. When Ms. Kleven crosses the stage with quizzical, stuttering steps, or Mr. Ingle balances in a low arabesque, or Ms. Omagbemi sits in a split and, smiling, slaps the ground, each seems to be slipping into something custom-made, for their bodies and the space.
