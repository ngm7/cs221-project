HONG KONG â€” Stocks around the world declined on Wednesday, a day after Mr. Trump posted a series of messages on Twitter warning that a fragile cease-fire in the trade war between the United States and China could be derailed. The drops in Asia and Europe came after stocks on Wall Street fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday.

But global investors appeared to be calmer than their counterparts in the United States, after official comments by the Chinese government that were vague but nevertheless expressed confidence that talks between the two countries would yield a positive outcome.

In Britain, France and Germany, stocks fell 0.6 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. In Hong Kong and in Taipei, Taiwan, investors sent the market down roughly 1.6 percent. Markets in Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo finished slightly more than half a percent lower.
