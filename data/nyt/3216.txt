2. The Senate voted resoundingly to withdraw U.S. military assistance for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, a stinging bipartisan rebuke of President Trump. The vote signaled anger among lawmakers in both parties for the president’s defense of the kingdom despite clear evidence of its role in the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Pentagon has been supplying Saudi Arabia with bombs and intelligence since 2015.

In Yemen, the warring sides took a step toward peace: a cease-fire in the port city of Hudaydah. Above, pro-government forces there.

The U.N. secretary general said the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition agreed to withdraw their forces from the city, which serves as a gateway for humanitarian aid.
