A charter bus carrying a Tennessee youth football team that had played a championship game in Dallas over the weekend crashed in Central Arkansas early Monday morning, killing one child and injuring more than 45 other people, the authorities said.

The Saline County coroner identified the victim as 9-year-old Kameron Johnson. The injured, mostly children, were taken to hospitals in Little Rock and Benton, Ark., according to the Arkansas State Police.

The police said the driver of the bus indicated in an initial statement that she lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll off Interstate 30, west of Benton, around 2:40 a.m.

The bus is owned by Scott Shuttle Service of Somerville, Tenn., the police said. According to records with the federal Department of Transportationâ€™s Safety and Fitness Electronic Records system, the charter company has had no crashes in the last two years. The records also show that the company was fined $3,490 in July, for allowing a driver to operate a truck without proper licensing.
