Until recently, at Cas Bar in Detroit, customers could get a beer or a shot of whiskey, or if they knew who to ask, an Instant Pot, a television or a few containers of air freshener.

The bar, on a corner of Michigan Avenue, with its wood-paneled walls, was home to a million-dollar organized retail fraud enterprise, according to Chief Ronald Haddad of the Dearborn Police Department in Dearborn, Mich.

The police raided Cas Bar last week, finding a hoard of stolen merchandise in the basement: pinball machines, stacks of energy drinks, alcohol, tools, a washing machine, Starbucks coffee, televisions, guns, ceiling fans, faucets and $600,000 stashed in a large box of Velveeta, the authorities said. The same day, the police also raided three other locations in the Detroit area that they suspected were used to store stolen merchandise.

In May, the authorities began surveilling the bar’s owner, Beverly Jo Sassin, after they arrested a man who had been accused of shoplifting “large amounts of alcohol” from a retail store in Dearborn, according to Chief Haddad. During an interview meant to determine if he needed help with drug addiction, the man explained to the police that he could “fence” the stolen goods at Cas Bar, the chief said.
