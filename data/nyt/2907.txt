With $136 billion in assets and enviable access to exclusive investment opportunities, Ivy League universities have long boasted that their endowments earn higher returns than other investors.

Not anymore.

This year the 10-year returns achieved by the endowments for all the Ivy League schools lagged a plain-vanilla portfolio of stocks and bonds, according to a new study by Markov Processes International, which closely monitors the performance of Ivy League endowments. It’s the first time that has happened in the 16 years for which Markov has data on all the Ivy League endowments.

The simulated portfolio is conservative, made up of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, and it achieved an annualized return of 8.1 percent. Not one Ivy League school beat that performance, although Princeton came the closest at 8.03 percent, edging out Columbia (7.98 percent). Far behind were Cornell, with an annualized return of just 4.8 percent, and Harvard, in last place at 4.5 percent.

A slightly more aggressive mix of 70 percent stocks and 30 percent bonds surpassed the Ivies’ results by an even greater margin.
