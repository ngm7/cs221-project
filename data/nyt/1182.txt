Officer in “I can’t breathe” case

Four years after placing Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, Officer Daniel Pantaleo appeared at Police Headquarters on Thursday.

So did Mr. Garner’s mother, sister and supporters.

People packed a fourth-floor trial room at One Police Plaza for the first hearing of Officer Pantaleo’s disciplinary case. He is accused of violating Police Department policy by using excessive force against the 43-year-old Mr. Garner.
