You can smell the bakery from underneath the East Harlem train tracks long before you see it. Past the retail and takeout stalls of La Marqueta food marketplace, you’ll find Hot Bread Kitchen. As the name suggests, hot bread was coming out of the oven on a recent afternoon.

“Oh, it smells so good in here,” said Zuleika Hernandez, 32, while walking through the door.

Ms. Hernandez had just gotten off work at Google’s New York offices in Chelsea, where she prepares salads in the kitchen. Breakfast, too. The overnight oatmeal cup is her specialty.
