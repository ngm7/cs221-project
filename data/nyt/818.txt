And you can understand the thinking, in the current uncertain climate. It worked very well once, why shouldn’t it work again? Plus, on the constantly churning fashion hamster wheel, it takes a little creative pressure off designers to constantly make something new and fabulous. Instead, they can give you the familiar and fabulous!

So Donatella did.

The occasion for the Versace trip down memory lane was the brand’s first pre-fall collection show, its first show in New York and its first show as a member of the Michael Kors family — sorry, the Capri Holdings family (remember, the holding company has been renamed, now that it’s a group). As a way of announcing Versace’s new status and suggesting that, contrary to some fears, being owned by an American company would not make the brand forget its roots, the show was a pretty high-profile statement.

“Donatella came to me and said she wanted to do something big, and I was all for it!” said John D. Idol, chief executive of Capri, before the show. It was the first Versace show he attended, and he was wearing his first Versace suit (black, slim-cut), as well as a pair of Versace Chain Reaction sneakers (also black, with white soles). He was very excited.

He was standing on the edge of the cavernous former trading floor of the old American Stock Exchange, where the show was held. In the center of the room was another recreation: the hand holding the torch from the Statue of Liberty — but this being Versace, it was gilded. Which was part of a whole ode-to-New-York thing that Ms. Versace saw as important to the collection, as well as being part of an ode-to-female-freedom thing (ditto).
