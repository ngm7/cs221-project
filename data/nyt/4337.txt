When I met my husband six years ago, we went overboard in an attempt to sweep each other off our feet: Elaborate dinners at fussy restaurants, loud, late nights at trendy bars, hidden speakeasies that required a secret password for admittance. (Remember when speakeasies were a thing?)

It felt like we were performing romance rather than inviting romance into our lives. Having every date be an Instagrammable moment was, frankly, unsustainable. While these whirlwind evenings seemed like they’d be a lot of fun, they were exhausting to plan and mostly left us broke, overstuffed and hung over. We realized we didn’t need a series of extravagant events to connect with each other — we just needed to carve out time to connect.

Now when I plan a romantic date, there’s only one rule I follow: Choose things I know my husband will enjoy. That’s it. What we do on our date doesn’t have to blow his hair back; it just has to make him feel relaxed, appreciated, excited and loved.
