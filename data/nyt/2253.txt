Theresa May prevails in a no-confidence vote

The British prime minister survived the greatest threat yet to her leadership, winning a confidence motion called by lawmakers in her own Conservative Party.

But it was something of a hollow victory. Mrs. May had to promise her party that she would not stand for re-election, and while she got the support of 200 Conservative lawmakers, 117 voted against her. That sizable opposition could still imperil the parliamentary prospects of her Brexit proposal, experts said.

Impact: Under Conservative Party rules, Mrs. May canâ€™t be challenged again for a year, which will give her some time and solid ground.
