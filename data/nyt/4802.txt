“The Dance” is perhaps not the best painting by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí, but it’s probably the one with the most interesting history.

A first version hung in New York’s Ziegfeld Theater and was later lost in the fire that destroyed the Mount Kisco home of the theater’s owner, the Broadway impresario Billy Rose. Dalí made a second copy for Rose, who sold it. One owner later, it ended up in the home of Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug kingpin whose cocaine empire placed him among the world’s richest people and whose terror campaigns paralyzed his country.

Now a fuller vision of what happened next to the painting, sometimes known as “Rock ’n’ Roll,” is recounted in a new book published in Spanish by Escobar’s wife, Victoria Eugenia Henao. In the book, “Pablo Escobar: My Life and My Prison,” she recalls her feelings when she first spotted the work by Dalí.
