To the Editor:

Re “Where Are All the Female Architects?,” by Allison Arieff (Sunday Review, Dec. 16):

I’m a 38-year-old architect with children. I own a thriving firm, and I attended the Yale School of Architecture as a single mom with a toddler. I’ve experienced a wide sampling of icky moments — from “helpful” hands climbing up ladders to needing to prove myself on construction sites in a way that my male colleagues don’t — but I believe that what drives women away is straightforward.

In architecture firms, long hours are valued above all else. Take-home pay minus child care is close to zero.

These problems originate in a culture of hazing and disrespect at architecture schools, where adequate sleep is mocked, and public humiliation during presentations is the norm (often ending in tears).

This culture creates a broken profession unable to advocate for decent wages or working conditions, and it seeps into the work force.
