Turning Point: The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on immigration, which requires that any person crossing the border illegally be prosecuted, results in the separation of thousands of children from their families.

The audio went live at 3:51 p.m. on June 18, 2018.

Obtained from a source who risked being fired for releasing it and published by ProPublica, the investigative journalism nonprofit, the recording captured 10 Central American children pleading with agents and consular workers at a United States Customs and Border Protection facility.

The children had been separated from their parents and families as part of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting everyone apprehended crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally. The audio is seven minutes and 47 seconds of children crying. Again and again, over and over, “Mami!” and “Papá!” A 6-year-old Salvadoran girl begs someone to call an aunt whose number she has memorized. Over their cries, a Border Patrol agent can be heard joking. “Well, we have an orchestra here,” he says grimly, chillingly. “What we’re missing is a conductor.”

All of us, to varying degrees, display ignorance about some of the world’s problems. Sometimes we are simply unaware of the suffering of those around us. Other times we are willfully ignorant, choosing, for one reason or another, to deny or ignore some difficult or painful reality. We all have our reasons and our alibis.
