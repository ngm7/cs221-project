To the Editor:

“How to Be 30 Years Younger” (Phys Ed column, Science Times, Nov. 27) says that older men and women who have exercised regularly for decades may “have healthier muscles, brains, immune systems and hearts than people of the same age who are sedentary. ”

I’ve never asked my doctor to compare me (at 76) to a man in his 30s, but I suspect that I might come out favorably. And the primary reason is that I have played handball two to three times a week for 57 years.

Handball is a fast-moving game that exercises most of the body’s muscles and engages the brain as well. It forces players to use their nondominant hands, to run after and hit a small hard ball, and to use their brains to outwit their opponents.

When I am playing, I feel as if I’m young.
