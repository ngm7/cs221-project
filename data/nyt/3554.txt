1. Calling the crimes “a very serious offense,” a federal judge postponed the sentencing of Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser.

The judge warned that Mr. Flynn could face prison for lying to federal investigators about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition and hiding his role lobbying for Turkey.

“I cannot assure that if you proceed today you will not receive a sentence of incarceration,” the judge said. He gave Mr. Flynn, above, the option of delaying the sentencing until he had completed his cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.
