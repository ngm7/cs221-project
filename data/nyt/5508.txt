Our 2018 Travel issues reimagined what travel writing means. For one, a handful of writers addressed a place they’d encountered in films or novels (including Hayao Miyazaki’s “Princess Mononoke” and Richard Adams’s “Watership Down”); for the other, we published five original fairy tales that spanned the globe, unfolding in settings like Florida’s swampland and an ancient Turkish forest. And our guides throughout the year featured places that were no less far-flung: the Peruvian Andes, Maui’s Upcountry and even Livingston, Mont. Here, the most captivating destinations T visited this year.
