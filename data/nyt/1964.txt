He directed the agent to buy two AR-15-style rifles for him, and he was arrested immediately after he took possession of the weapons on Friday, according to the affidavit. Officials noted that the arrest came as Jewish communities celebrated Hanukkah. They declined to identify the synagogue targeted.

Mr. Joseph’s court-appointed lawyer, Neil McElroy, had no immediate comment on the case.

In the second case, Ms. Lecron was charged with one count of transporting explosives with the intent to injure people or damage property. She helped obtain materials for a pipe bomb to target a pipeline in Georgia, officials said.

A lawyer for Ms. Lecron did not immediately return a call for comment on Monday. The maximum penalty for the criminal count she faces is 10 years in prison.

The investigation into Ms. Lecron began in June, when an unidentified caller pointed the authorities to her Tumblr account, where she had posted pictures and comments glorifying mass shooters, including Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine people at a Charleston church in 2015.

In August, the authorities learned that Ms. Lecron was planning a visit to Columbine High School, in Colorado, where two teenagers killed 13 people in 1999. She had called the shooters “godlike” on her Tumblr page.

While she was there, the investigators searched her home and found weapons and ammunition, as well as end caps, which can be used to make pipe bombs, according to a criminal complaint. They also found a diary.

“Soon we will bring destruction on society,” she had written.

Over the summer, Ms. Lecron became pen pals with Mr. Roof, a white supremacist who has remained unrepentant for his 2015 attack on an African-American church, which killed nine people. He was sentenced to death and is in an Indiana prison. Ms. Lecron sent him a book about a Nazi fighter and counseled him to “stay strong.”
