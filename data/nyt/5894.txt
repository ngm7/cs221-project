Major League Soccer announced Friday that it had reached an agreement to transfer control of the Columbus Crew to a local ownership group that has pledged to keep the team in Ohio.

The deal will prevent the Crew’s threatened move to Austin, Tex., and end an ugly fight that had driven a wedge between the team’s fans and the organization — at the same time it highlighted the power of fan activism in driving the direction of a pro sports team.

Friday’s announcement that Crew’s current owner, Precourt Sports Ventures, had agreed to surrender control of the team to a group that includes the owner of the N.F.L.’s Cleveland Browns, included the caveat that the final agreement had not been signed. But the new owners have announced plans to build a new stadium for the team, and M.L.S. said the group — led by the Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and the longtime Crew team physician Peter Edwards — would take over the team’s operations in January.
