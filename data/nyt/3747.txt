Germany had Goethe. India had Tagore. For France, it was Victor Hugo. When nationalism swept the world in the 19th century, country after country, along with flag and anthem, demanded a guiding literary voice to stand as an avatar for the country as a whole — a national poet. In America, no one embodied this role like Walt Whitman.

“I think Walt Whitman went to the help-wanted section and found a squib that said, ‘Wanted: National Poet’,” the novelist Allan Gurganus once said in a PBS interview. “And he was innocent enough to believe that if he could just write a poem that incorporated everything he felt and suspected and hoped for from America, that he would have the position. And you know, by God, he did it.”
