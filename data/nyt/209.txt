Mr. Matthews grew up in a sprawling public housing complex on the edge of the Astoria neighborhood in Queens. He left school in 2009 but quickly found that he could not get the kind of jobs that he wanted. He was especially interested in a career with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

“You need your high school diploma,” Mr. Matthews said. “To drive, to do construction work, a high school diploma.”

Over the next few years, Mr. Matthews tried to earn a high school equivalency diploma. Several of his friends took their tests alongside him. They passed, opening up new job and life opportunities. But Mr. Matthews failed — five times.

“It was the math,” he recalled in a recent interview. “I couldn’t get past that. I get to the math, I’m freaking sweating. I’m getting nervous.”
