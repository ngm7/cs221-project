New Jersey state officials said on Saturday that they opened a civil rights investigation into the case of a black high school wrestler with dreadlocks who was forced to make a choice: cut his hair or forfeit his match.

The wrestler, Andrew Johnson, was told by a referee that his hair and the hair cover he was wearing violated wrestling rules during a competition on Thursday in southern New Jersey. He wanted to compete. So he stood, forlorn and resigned, as he received a hurried, last-minute haircut while teammates from Buena Regional High School, 30 miles from Atlantic City, shouted their support.

With his dreadlocks shorn, Mr. Johnson went on to win his match but the episode drew widespread attention and condemnation.

Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said in a statement: “Seeing Mr. Johnson forced by an official into a choice between giving up who he is or giving up his ability to compete was nothing short of disturbing. That he went on to win his match after this experience speaks to an incredible depth of character — and to our need to see that no future student-athlete has to endure a similar situation.”
