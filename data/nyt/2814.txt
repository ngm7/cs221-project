Sweet, meaty sea scallops are best in winter, and like many other luxury foods, they tend to appear in abundance during the holiday season. Though it doesn’t come cheap, the splendid sea scallop is exceedingly easy to prepare.

To find the best product for your money, g et yourself to a good fishmonger. Ask for fresh large or medium day-boat scallops, also called dry-packed — frozen scallops do not qualify here . (Frozen scallops, instead of browning, just weep in the pan, flooding it with their juices ; most are dipped in a preservative solution before freezing.)

When you have scallops that are freshly harvested, you can serve them raw for a delightful first course. Make a scallop crudo, thinly sliced and adorned with just a speck of coarse salt, a dribble of extra-virgin olive oil and a drop of lemon. Or use raw diced scallops to make a ceviche, doused very briefly in lime juice and sparked with hot green chile, onion and cilantro.
