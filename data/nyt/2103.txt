Below are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book over the next month. You can also submit your own questions for Gerald on our Facebook page, which he will answer on the NewsHour broadcast at the end of the month. Spoiler alert on questions further down.

1. Where is the title, “There Will Be No Miracles Here,” drawn from, and why?

2. Early on in the book, Gerald writes that in our society, people who are addicted to fame and money are perceived as just “a little lower than the angels” while people addicted to drugs are “down below water bugs.” How does he make clear early on that this won’t be a typical rags-to-riches memoir?

3. Gerald’s religion plays a big role in this book. At one point, he argues that in today’s world many people believe themselves too brilliant or too secular to believe in God, which he attributes to a kind of “anti-hope.” What does he mean by anti-hope? What do you think of his argument?
