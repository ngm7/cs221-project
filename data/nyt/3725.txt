On festive winter nights, votive holders filled with flickering tea lights can add instant ambience to a room. “They give you that sparkling effect,” said the interior designer Miles Redd, who uses them often, especially when he’s entertaining.

“It makes everything seem rich and glittering,” he said.

Compared with standard taper candles, Mr. Redd continued, tea lights have a slightly more casual vibe — with less cause for worry. “Tapers sometimes drip wax on things, which can be a nuisance,” he said. “And votives are a little safer.”

Also, “the light is lower, a little more discreet and softer.”

For maximum impact, he suggested using them in multiples.

“I’m a fan of more, for sure,” Mr. Redd said. “I put them on the mantel, I put them on tables, and I certainly put them on the dining table. They’re good anywhere you want a little pool of light.”
