“Not all of them will succeed, but I think some, maybe many, will,” said Jacob Weisberg, the former chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group, who recently started a new podcasting company, Pushkin Industries, with the author Malcolm Gladwell. “This is another one of these forms that’s being invented in the moment.”

Nicholas Quah, the writer of HotPod, a newsletter about podcasts, said there was room for more daily shows. “I am dying for a daily on sports news and a podcast that covers international news and Asia, where I’m from,” he said.

Some newsy daily podcasts have already faltered. BuzzFeed’s “Reporting to You” and The Outline’s “World Dispatch” ended their runs in September.

Despite those failed experiments, other news organizations are betting big on the medium. Here’s a look at eight recently introduced news podcasts that have a chance to last.

The podcast: ‘Up First’

The organization: NPR.

The hosts: Rachel Martin, 44; David Greene, 42; Steve Inskeep, 50; and Noel King, 37, otherwise known as the gang from “Morning Edition.” Lately, the hosts have come in contact with fans — usually young adults — who don’t know them from the radio. “It’s funny, as someone who spent most of her career at NPR, this legacy news organization, that people now identify my name with the podcast,” Ms. Martin said.
