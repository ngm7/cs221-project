3. Planned Parenthood is facing accusations of discriminating against pregnant workers.

The organization has been accused of sidelining, ousting or otherwise handicapping pregnant employees, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees. A spokeswoman said the organization was investigating the allegations we reported.

The accusations are a sign that discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers remains widespread in the workplace â€” even in organizations that define themselves as champions of women. Above, in Manhattan.

In some cases, managers were accused of considering pregnancy in hiring decisions, for example, or denying rest breaks recommended by a doctor. Some women said they were afraid to announce a pregnancy at work, sensing they would be seen as abandoning their colleagues.
