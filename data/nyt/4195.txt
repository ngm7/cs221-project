‘Do Not Steal Cough Medicine’

A sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, went south on Tuesday after a judge berated him and suggested that Flynn’s efforts to mislead federal investigators warranted prison. The judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, encouraged Flynn to accept his offer to postpone the sentencing, so that he could have extra time to prove the value of his cooperation with prosecutors.

Sullivan held Flynn’s feet to the fire, even floating the question of whether his crimes amounted to treason (although prosecutors never charged him with that). On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert was happy to review some of the hearing’s most squirm-inducing moments.
