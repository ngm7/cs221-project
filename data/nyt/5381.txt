Re “A Year of 101 Rejections,” by Emily Winter (Sunday Review, Dec. 16):

As a 17-year-old, I’m fortunate enough to say that I’ve experienced only one major rejection in my life. In fact, coincidentally, I was rejected by my early-decision college just one day before the article’s publication. And I’m proud to report that I handled the rejection reasonably well; no tears were shed.

I cannot begin to fathom the mental anguish and turmoil Ms. Winter inflicted upon herself over the course of the year. Her resilience and willingness to find humor in rejection have helped me eliminate my shame and have encouraged me to share my failure with other seniors going through the college application process.

I’m even thinking of challenging Ms. Winter’s rejection record with my nine remaining applications; that would bring my count up to 10. Only 92 rejections left to go to pass her.

Emily Winter has my empathy and sympathy for her 101 rejections, but the number pales in comparison to my nearly 800 during 2018. For letter writers to newspapers and magazines, rejection is part of the game.
