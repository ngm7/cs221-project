If the Yankees are spending the winter trying to forget how their 2018 season ended — watching the rival Boston Red Sox celebrate not once, but twice, at Yankee Stadium — it will not get any easier when they start the 2019 exhibition season.

The Yankees, who announced their exhibition schedule on Friday, will play their first game on Feb. 23 against — you guessed it — the Red Sox, who poured a lot of Champagne in the Bronx this fall. Boston won the American League East in a September game at Yankee Stadium and then repeated the insult with a division-series clincher in October.

The Red Sox then went on to win the World Series in five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Red Sox, who will be the home team for the Grapefruit League opener, said that there would most likely be some sort of acknowledgment of last season’s championship that day but that nothing had been decided as of yet.

It is not that the Yankees are gluttons for punishment; the exhibition schedule was worked out last August, before the Red Sox had won anything.
