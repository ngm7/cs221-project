To the Editor:

Dear Mr. President,

I am writing to you as a father of two wonderful little girls who are 9 and 11. Being a parent has been the greatest blessing of my life, and I feel privileged each day that I am allowed to help mold, guide, teach and be an example to them. I know that you are a parent and hope that you can relate.

In this complex world I do my best to shield my girls from the darkness, although I am honest with them about all issues to a degree appropriate for their age. We try to focus on the positive aspects of life, all the beauty, kindness and generosity.

The mother of my girls is a sergeant in the Army and has just returned from a one-year deployment in Kuwait. She is an amazing woman, mother and soldier, so our daughters understand duty, sacrifice and patriotism.

You are without question a success financially, as a businessman, as a celebrity and as a politician. So let us give credit where credit is due. Our economy seems to be in great shape, I have a good career, and I live a comfortable life relative to the majority of the world. I agree with some of your policies, disagree with some. I try to be a moderate and not an extremist in either political direction.
