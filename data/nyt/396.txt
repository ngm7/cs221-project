U.S. Soccer took 14 months to pick a new men’s national team coach, but Earnie Stewart knew whom he wanted even before he placed a phone call to the man who would eventually get the job.

After starting in his new post as national team general manager on Aug. 1, Stewart began making calls — to coaches, sporting directors and respected former United States players — to solicit their advice in creating a literal bullet-pointed list of the qualities required in the new coach. The final profile included résumé basics like coaching licenses and top-flight experience; management-speak qualities like “open-minded and innovative” and “excellent communication skills”; and curiously specific ones, like an openness and understanding of data analytics and a “calm and confident sideline demeanor.”

Stewart’s list of candidates — more than 30 at first — was scored against the profile and then cut to about a dozen. And then, in late August, he picked up the phone.

“He called me on my cellphone,” said Gregg Berhalter, who was introduced as the national team’s new coach on Tuesday in New York. Stewart, Berhalter said, began with a simple question: “What do you think about discussing this?”
