WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The police in New Zealand found a body Sunday in their search for Grace Millane, a British backpacker who vanished a week ago on the night before her 22nd birthday.

The announcement came a day after the police said that they were questioning a 26-year-old man in connection with Ms. Millane’s disappearance, and that they believed she was dead. The man, who has not been named, was charged with murder Saturday night and will appear in the Auckland District Court on Monday.

On Sunday, officers cordoned off part of a road that runs through a forested area of the Waitakere Ranges on the western outskirts of Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city.

Detective Inspector Scott Beard said a body had been found “about 10 meters” off the road. A formal identification will take place Monday, but he said he believed the body was Ms. Millane’s.
