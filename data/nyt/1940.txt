Both before and after a meeting on Tuesday with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders in Congress, President Trump pushed a false narrative about the progress of a new wall along the country’s southwest border.

The wall — and funding for it — is the biggest sticking point between the two parties with a partial government shutdown days away unless Congress passes a spending package by Friday of next week. Mr. Trump has insisted that $5 billion for a border wall must be included in the spending package under consideration.

Here is some additional context about Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts on Tuesday morning and his conversation, hours later, with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer.
