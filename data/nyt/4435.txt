Years ago, when the baseball world looked ahead to this winter’s starry free-agent class, Matt Harvey stood out as an especially compelling name. He started the All-Star Game for the Mets in 2013 — his first full major league season — and two years later, after having Tommy John surgery, he started the first and last games of the World Series.

But the years since then have been rough on Harvey, whose New York career burned out in a series of injuries and off-field distractions. After a calm and reasonably effective summer in Cincinnati following a trade from the Mets, Harvey found a new home on Tuesday night.

Harvey agreed to a one-year, $11 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels, and can also earn a possible $3 million in incentives based on games started. The agreement, first reported by MLB.com, was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of it who was not authorized to speak publicly because the deal was not yet official.

Harvey, who will turn 30 in March, went 7-7 with a 4.50 E.R.A. in 24 starts with the Reds, who acquired him in a trade for catcher Devin Mesoraco after the Mets had designated him for assignment. Harvey had been demoted to the bullpen with the Mets after four starts in which he allowed 14 runs in 21 innings.
