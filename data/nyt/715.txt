Just a few years before, Mr. Levy had been chosen as prom king at his Brooklyn high school, and he planned to go to college. But as graduation approached, his family’s financial problems came into focus.

“I didn’t really pay attention to the bad stuff at that time until I graduated high school and I realized that my mom really needs help,” he said. “I wanted to go to college, too, but honestly, I knew if I went to college, my mom was going to be really struggling. So I decided not to go.”

Born in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Levy moved to New York with his mother and his sister when he was 5. His mother, a nurse, was persuaded by family in New York to move for more career opportunities. But the three of them found themselves jumping from apartment to apartment in Brooklyn.

After Mr. Levy’s sister went to college, he and his mother ended up sharing a bedroom.

“And that wasn’t fun,” he said, laughing. “I’m 16, I’m living with my mom. But I went through it.”
