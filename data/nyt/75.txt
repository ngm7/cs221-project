WASHINGTON — A fourth soldier has died as a result of a roadside bomb in central Afghanistan last week, the Pentagon announced on Monday, marking the episode as the single largest loss of American life in the war since 2015.

Sgt. Jason M. McClary, 24, was in the armored vehicle that was hit by Taliban militants in Ghazni Province on Nov. 27. He died of his wounds in Landstuhl, Germany, on Sunday.

Two Defense Department officials said the attack was well coordinated. The bomb was detonated by a trigger man who targeted the American vehicle in the middle of the joint Afghan and American convoy.

The explosion flipped the soldiers’ mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, killing Army Capt. Andrew Patrick Ross, 29; Sgt. 1st Class Eric Michael Emond, 39; and Air Force Staff Sgt. Dylan J. Elchin, 25.
