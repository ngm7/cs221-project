1. Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, was sentenced to three years in prison, in part for his role in a scheme during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.

Prosecutors also announced they had struck a deal with the tabloid publisher American Media Inc., which played an important role in keeping those women silent.

In federal court in Manhattan, the judge said Mr. Cohen, above, had committed a “veritable smorgasbord” of crimes involving deception and “motivated by personal greed and ambition,” each of which “standing alone warrant serious punishment.”
