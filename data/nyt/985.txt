This week, a 9-year-old boy threw the first “legal” snowball in Severance, Colo. It was the culmination of a campaign the boy, Dane Best, had led to repeal a nearly century-old ban on snowball throwing in Severance, a town of about 6,000 people about 50 miles north of Denver.

There was no snow on the ground outside Town Hall on Monday night. But after the Town Board’s trustees were swayed by Dane’s presentation, members of the town staff presented a snowball preserved in a freezer to Dane. Then, before a scrum of television cameras and reporters, he leaned back and hurled the snowball into the air.

At the mayor’s office on Tuesday morning, Dane fielded calls from news outlets from around the world with his mother, Brooke Best.

He had been up late the night before taping an appearance for “Good Morning America” and had also been featured in local newspapers and USA Today as well as on National Public Radio and several television networks.
