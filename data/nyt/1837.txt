WACO, Tex. — It’s a n unlikely tourist town. A flat, dusty stretch, Waco was until recently best known in Texas as the halfway point between Dallas and Austin, or Baylor University’s college town. Nationally, it was most famous for its proximity to the 51-day standoff between the F.B.I. and Branch Davidians in 1993 that resulted in almost 80 dead in a fire.

That’s all changed now, thanks to “Fixer Upper,” the HGTV home makeover show that premiered in 2013 and ended this year after five seasons. It followed Chip and Joanna Gaines, an attractive, can-do construction and design couple, as they renovated buildings all over Waco, transforming old houses into cozy homes with plenty of shiplap on the walls. They filmed there for a reason: As they explained on their website, an “unnecessary strain on our families and children” was out of the question. (The couple’s oldest child, Drake, was nine when the first season aired, and in June of this year, a fifth child, Crew, was born.)
