Faye Dunaway will play Katharine Hepburn in a one-person show planned for Broadway next summer, the show’s producer announced on Thursday.

According to the announcement, Ms. Dunaway will star in a revised version of Matthew Lombardo’s “Tea at Five,” to be directed by John Tillinger.

The play had its debut at Hartford Stage in 2002, starring Kate Mulgrew, and later moved Off Broadway.

No theater or opening date was included in the plan, which was announced by Ben Feldman, whose other Broadway producing credits include revivals of “M. Butterfly” and “Pippin.”
