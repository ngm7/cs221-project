The Netherlands is considering referring Russia to an international court after reaching an impasse with the Kremlin over responsibility for shooting down a civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people, many of them Dutch citizens.

In a letter delivered to the Dutch Parliament on Thursday morning, the country’s foreign minister, Stef Blok, said that Russia had rebuffed all efforts to start negotiations on a possible settlement or compensation for the victims of the 2014 attack on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, and that the government was considering “potential next steps” including “submitting the matter to an international court or organization.”

The Netherlands and Australia, whose citizens made up a large number of the victims, made “several requests to Russia through diplomatic channels to engage in formal meetings on this matter, with a view to establishing the truth and achieving justice and accountability for the victims and their next of kin,” Mr. Blok wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times.

The diplomatic efforts, he said, have not produced negotiations “concerning Russia’s responsibility,” though the Dutch government remains open to dialogue should the Kremlin wish to come to the table.
