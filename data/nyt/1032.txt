Robert Rainwater, a curator and art historian who oversaw an expansion of the New York Public Library’s holdings in modern and contemporary prints, artist-made books and printed ephemera from the 1970s onward, died on Nov. 13 at his home in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. He was 75.

His death was announced by Max Schumann, president of Printed Matter, a nonprofit distributor dedicated to artist’s books and related publications, where Mr. Rainwater was a longtime board member. The medical examiner’s office said the cause was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Throughout his 37-year career at the library — including two decades as the first chief librarian of the Wallach Division, which combined the library’s vast holdings in art, prints and photographs — Mr. Rainwater worked on acquisitions, exhibitions and public programs, including a series of interviews with artists organized with Printed Matter.

His first exhibition was “Women Printmakers” (1973), which brought to light a long-neglected gift to the library of about 800 prints by female artists from the 16th to the 19th centuries. He also mounted shows of liturgical manuscripts, Japanese handscrolls and works of the 19th-century French printmakers Charles Meryon and Félix Buhot.
