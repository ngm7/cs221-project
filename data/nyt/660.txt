IAGO is the main antagonist of Shakespeare’s “Othello.” The name appeared as the answer to 64-Across in last Wednesday’s puzzle by David J. Kahn, clued as “‘I am not what I am’ speaker.”

Iago plots against the Moorish general Othello out of jealousy, after Othello snubs him for the role of chief lieutenant, selecting Cassio instead. Throughout the play, Iago’s elaborate plan unfolds, which revolves around false accusations of an affair between Cassio and Othello’s lover, Desdemona.

Othello’s trust of Iago’s claims and purported evidence leads to the general’s eventual demise. He orders Iago to kill Cassio, then attacks Desdemona and ultimately takes his own life after realizing Iago’s scheme much too late.

IAGO has nearly 400 total appearances in The New York Times Crossword. It is sometimes clued with respect to Jafar’s parrot sidekick in “Aladdin.”
