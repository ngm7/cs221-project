By 2000, Fox Kids Europe was in 32 million households across 56 countries, and turning a profit. In 2001, the Walt Disney Company acquired Fox Family Worldwide for $5.3 billion. Mr. Kreiz left the next year.

His next big job proved to be more challenging.

In 2007, he was named chief executive of the Dutch television company Endemol, the maker of reality and game shows like “Big Brother” and “Deal or No Deal.” It had recently been bought for $3.55 billion by three private investors.

Within a few months, the company was struggling amid the financial crisis, heavy debt from the acquisition and plummeting advertising revenue.

In interviews, three former Endemol executives gave Mr. Kreiz credit for restructuring what they called an extremely fragmented business, diversifying into scripted programming and forming a distribution business. Eventually, Mr. Kreiz and members of the Endemol board differed over strategy. He left in 2011.

“The shareholders did not see success with Ynon,” said Just Spee, who joined Endemol in 2010 as chief financial officer and later became its chief executive. “Was that fair? The debt was there before he came in. The industry was under a lot of pressure, particularly in Southern Europe.”

“From where I sat,” Mr. Spee added, “the company was brain-dead and he re-energized it.”

Two years later, Mr. Kreiz was back on more familiar territory as chief executive of Maker Studios.

Maker, a media company very much in start-up mode, was part of an emerging YouTube ecosystem that pooled studio resources and branding opportunities for tens of thousands of people hoping to become stars by creating short-form videos.
