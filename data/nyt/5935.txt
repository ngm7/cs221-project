Good morning. I write from north-central Utah, a house under the Wasatch Range, snowshoe hares darting across the road outside, a moose sighted not long ago down by the corner that leads into town. The meals here are enormous, to feed teenagers who are present for as far as the eye can see, and they come repeatedly, in waves: for early risers; for not-early risers; for late risers looking for bacon that was fried off and eaten hours before. Lunch follows a reverse pattern, and then soon enough it’s time for dinner in waves as well, though someone will need to stop off at the market for milk beforehand because another gallon’s gone to, what — afternoon cereal?

A good thing to cook today: paella. It stretches nicely and feeds a lot of people, and is festive as the season demands. My pal Doc Willoughby has a nice recipe for a turf-centric paella with rabbit and chorizo; and another for a seafood paella with shrimp and clams. I’ve got a nice recipe for grilled paella (above) with just about every protein available at the market and fishmonger. (You can make all of those on a stovetop, easy.) And Florence Fabricant has a recipe for paella with mixed sausages that, she says, you can make in hardly more time than it takes “to babysit a risotto.” If all else fails, make that today and be proud of yourself.

And that’s Sunday taken care of, right there. Monday brings New Year’s Eve, that whole catastrophe. My advice: Only leave your home to celebrate if there’s a dress code and a band is playing, and cook at home before you go. Make steak Diane for two if it’s just the two of you celebrating, and it ought to be if you’re going to head out at 11 to hear a band, all dressed up.

Otherwise: set yourself up today to make some pan pizza tomorrow, then snuggle in to watch “Derry Girls” until it’s like 10 p.m., and you can credibly turn out the lights and get a good night’s sleep.
