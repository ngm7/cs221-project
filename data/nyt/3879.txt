XXXTentacion, the Florida rapper who was killed in June at age 20, reached No. 1 with his first posthumous album, while Billboard decided to uphold its results in a contested chart two weeks ago in which the accuracy of its data had been called into question.

“Skins” (Bad Vibes Forever/Empire), XXXTentacion’s third album, reached the top spot with the equivalent of 132,000 sales in the United States last week, which includes 52,000 in sales of the full album and 122 million streams of its tracks on services like Spotify and Apple Music, according to Nielsen data reported by Billboard. It is the second time that XXXTentacion — who was awaiting trial on charges of battery, false imprisonment and witness tampering at the time of his death — has topped the chart, following his last album, “?,” in March.

Meek Mill’s “Championships” (Maybach/Atlantic), last week’s chart topper, fell one spot to No. 2 in its second week, and Michael Bublé’s holiday album “Christmas” — a seasonal chart hit every year since its initial release in 2011 — is in third place.

On Tuesday, Billboard also announced the results of an audit of its album chart covering the week that ended Nov. 29, when Travis Scott’s four-month-old album “Astroworld” beat the rapper 6ix9ine’s “Dummy Boy” for the top spot. Those results were immediately contested, with questions being raised over the data collected and processed by Nielsen — Billboard’s longtime partner on its charts — and the increasingly common practice of bundling albums with sales of concert tickets or merchandise, a tactic widely seen as a way for artists to boost their chart positions.
