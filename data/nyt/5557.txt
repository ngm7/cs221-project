David Austin, a self-taught horticulturist who upended the rose market by creating more than 200 hybrids that were distinguished by their broad color range, ambrosial fragrances and multiple annual blooms, died on Dec. 18 at his home in Albrighton, in Shropshire County, England. He was 92.

His company, David Austin Roses, announced the death but did not specify the cause.

Mr. Austin spent six decades obsessively pursuing his ideal of what a rose could be by developing varieties that combined the fragrances of the so-called old roses that he adored — but that had largely disappeared from modern gardens — with the rich palette and repeat flowerings of the stiff and lightly scented hybrid teas and floribundas that had long become dominant in nurseries, flower shops and home vases.

Mr. Austin later recalled that he had to ignore doubters who insisted that nobody would grow his old-but-new roses.

“I was never that influenced by what other people said or thought,” he told Gardens Illustrated magazine in 2002. “I’m slightly dyslexic, and I think I make connections that other people don’t.”
