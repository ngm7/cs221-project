The Fed raised rates, but it’s bracing for economic strain

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate yesterday to between 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, and signaled that it expects “some” additional rate increases next year.

The Fed believes the U.S. economy is strong. “Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement,” Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT writes. He adds that it was “a display of measured confidence in the economy.”

But the move is a slap in the face to vocal critics. “Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed’s plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings,” Mr. Appelbaum writes. “The Fed’s decision also rebuffed President Trump, who has broken with the practice of his predecessors by loudly and publicly campaigning for the Fed to keep rates low.”

Mr. Powell acknowledged new strains in recent months that included weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said that the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year, Mr. Applebaum writes. Officials now expect to raise rates just twice in 2019, not three times as previously suggested.
