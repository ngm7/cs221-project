Pat Comunale stood at the podium before a packed courtroom across from James Rackover, the man convicted last month in the brutal murder of his son. He dabbed his eyes with a tissue and choked out his words.

“We wake up everyday with the horror of what happened to him,” he said. “There are no more holidays, no more birthdays, just days that go by.”

Mr. Comunale recounted his son Joseph’s final moments: He was beaten and stabbed to death after a night of partying in Manhattan. His body was pushed from the fourth floor window of an East Side apartment building. Later it was burned and buried in a shallow grave on the Jersey Shore. For that, Mr. Comunale told a judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rackover deserved the maximum sentence permitted under the law.

Justice James Burke agreed. He sentenced Mr. Rackover, 27, on Wednesday to a minimum of 28 and 2/3 years in prison and a maximum of life for the murder of Mr. Comunale and related charges.
