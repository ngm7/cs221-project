“American Renegades” could use some seasoning to go with its meatheadeness. Written by Richard Wenk and Luc Besson, this workmanlike film has the no-frills efficiency of several other Besson productions, but it lacks the tongue-in-cheek humor of “Taken,” to say nothing of “Three Kings,” a non-Besson project to which the plot here — American soldiers search for looted gold — bears some resemblance.

The Nazis, we see in a prologue, stole the gold in question from the French. Now it’s 1995, in Bosnia, and the bounty is said to be locked in a vault at the bottom of a lake. Stanton (Charlie Bewley), a Navy SEAL, is tipped off to it by his girlfriend, Lara (Sylvia Hoeks), a local waitress who hopes to use the spoils to finance the rebuilding of her country.
