The Beautiful Ones

I am in a contract position and have been increasingly asked to do the duties of our workplace con artist. He is never in the office and consistently makes up stories. My first day, he insisted he was related to the Beale sisters by saying he was so poor that he had to eat cat food with them at Grey Gardens. Last week, I found out that his current name is made up. He told a co-worker that he doesn’t have a birth certificate because he was born in Spain. (He was born in Alabama.)

As I will not receive a full-time position at this job, even though I am doing my work and the work of a full-time employee, can I expose him? Or should I not care?

There are three big kinds of workplace liars:

The scary folks who believe their own lies. They’re weirdly not as dangerous, because if challenged they’ll just think you’re the liar instead. This will get weird! Exposure can backfire wildly.

The entitled, manipulative narcissists for whom lying is a means to an end. They don’t believe their lies, but they do believe they have an absolute right to do as they wish. Exposure will make them vengeful — and they’re capable and high-functioning.

Then there’s the alcoholics and drug addicts, who are only lying as a way to cover up things they don’t want you to know. They’re messy, but confronting them helps them!

Which do you have? I think … this all may be beside the point and that it’s time for you to reread the I.R.S. guidelines on what constitutes a contract worker and what constitutes an employee.
