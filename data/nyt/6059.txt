LONDON — Russia will miss an end-of-year deadline to turn over data on its athletes to the global regulator of drugs in sports, raising the specter of new penalties arising from a broad, state-supported cheating scandal in international competitions.

As a condition of lifting penalties that had largely barred Russia from hosting or participating in a range of international events because of cheating, it had pledged in September to deliver data from its corrupted antidoping laboratory to the regulator, the World Anti-Doping Agency.

That data would conclusively prove which of its athletes had been doping as part of the state-sanctioned program that marred several major sporting events, including the Olympic Games.

Yet missing the deadline means Russia has failed to comply with WADA’s request, putting pressure on the agency to reinstate the penalties, which a range of athletes and critics had said should have been maintained in the first place.
