NEW ORLEANS — As Mayor Mike Duggan was trying to revive Detroit, he traveled to other parts of the country and talked with planners and officials in flourishing urban areas. He had vacant buildings, left behind in the early 2000s, as jobs had dried up and 260,000 people left the financially stagnant city. Mr. Duggan heard about the downside of prosperity, including gentrification. So he asked, “If you were in Brooklyn and you could rewind the clock, what would you do differently?”

Leaders of other cities told him that instead of displacing existing residents, they would work harder to keep them in place as rents and property values increased. Mr. Duggan returned to Detroit and worked to help carry out an ordinance requiring developers who buy discounted city-owned land or receive a certain level of municipal support to include a minimum of 20 percent of permanent affordable-housing units in their buildings.
