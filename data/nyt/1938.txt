Electric Blue Eyes

He was a senior with electric blue eyes. I was a sophomore with a crush. Introductions turned into lunch, then into a college romance. We were untouchable. But nights squeezed into my dorm bed turned into breakups and “I can’t live without you” reunions. My senior year, two pink lines. He pawned his Martin guitar for a ring and sold his Jeep for a security deposit on a tiny Baltimore rowhouse. I walked across the graduation stage 6 months pregnant. None of it has been perfect. But you know what is? The way our little boy looks at us with the same blue eyes. — Elizabeth Mackey

Oktoberfest Meet Cute

We met in Munich during Oktoberfest. I had seen him the day I arrived, a handsome stranger exiting the train station. That night we matched on a dating app but didn’t connect. The next day, in a mass of beer drinkers dressed in traditional German clothes, I spotted him above the crowd, giving a toast atop a bench. We were wearing identical lederhosen. I pointed at him, slightly drunk, and said, “Hey you! Get down here!” As he jumped down, he said, “You found me!” I didn’t even know I was looking for him but, two years later, I still have him. — Ryan Leach
