It is rare for pets to be injured or die during air travel, Mrs. Wells said, but not being able to keep an eye on your pet for potential issues during the flight can increase the risk. The airline crew “may not be as familiar with your particular pet’s medical history, or even know how to recognize when your pet’s in distress,” Mrs. Wells explained. “I never travel with my pets in cargo; I won’t risk it,” she added.

Should I sedate my dog?

The I.P.A.T.A. does not recommend giving tranquilizers to any pet during air travel. It said sedation suppresses respiratory and body temperature regulation and can have other negative effects on the animal’s physiology.

But other types of medications or natural calming aids can make a big difference, from toys or treats to anything that has prescribed by your vet after a consultation about the upcoming trip.

Do I have the right paperwork?

While you’re asking your vet about health issues, you also need to fill out the necessary paperwork for your trip. You don’t want your pup to be detained at customs, do you?

Typically, you need an accredited veterinarian to perform an exam before your trip to obtain a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI). But depending on your destination, there are different admission requirements per state and country.

The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service website is a good place to start. Some states require additional permits, and international travel is even more complicated and may include a quarantine period when you land.
