CHICO, Calif. — Gabe Price was having another rough day. As he had every morning since escaping the deadliest wildfire in California’s history, the 17-year-old had woken up beside his father on a sagging air mattress at his grandparents’ house, now crammed with four extra people and a dog. Stress filled the cramped rooms like smoke, always on the verge of flaring into another argument.

Home — or what he had until recently known as home — is a pile of ashes. Paradise High School, where he is a senior, is cordoned off in an evacuation zone. Lessons are now all online, and Mr. Price desperately needed to find a Wi-Fi signal. So there he was, walking through a Muzak-filled shopping mall, where the Paradise school district had converted a former LensCrafters into a temporary school, wedged between a JCPenney and a toy store.

“This is the most stressful environment I’ve ever been in,” said Mr. Price, over the buzz of Spanish and algebra lessons nearby. “There’s nowhere I can get fully comfortable and I’ve got so much work to do.”

In the weeks since the Camp Fire killed at least 85 people and wiped out more than 18,000 buildings in Paradise and neighboring towns, those who fled have urgently searched for housing and normalcy, many still reeling from nightmares of the flames. The burden is particularly acute for Paradise High’s Class of 2019, 240 seniors on the cusp of adulthood whose post-graduation plans have been derailed by more pressing challenges.
