Selma Wynberg Engel, who escaped a Nazi extermination camp after a prisoner uprising and was among the first to tell the world about the camp’s existence, died on Tuesday in East Haven, Conn. She was 96.

Her daughter, Alida Engel, confirmed the death, at an assisted living facility.

A Dutch Jew, Mrs. Engel was among 58 prisoners who escaped from the secret Sobibor extermination camp in Eastern Poland and lived to see the end of the war. Only one other former Sobibor prisoner, Semyon Rozenfeld, of Israel, is believed to be alive today.

When the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Mrs. Engel was forced into hiding. In 1942, they seized her during a roundup of Jews and sent her to two concentration camps in succession before shipping her to Sobibor in April 1943. It was one of the Nazis’ camps used solely for the purpose of exterminating Jews.

Most prisoners sent to Sobibor were instantly gassed or shot to death, but Mrs. Engel, who was 20, was selected to sort the clothing of the dead and thus spared.
