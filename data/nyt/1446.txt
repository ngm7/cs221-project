Nine months ago, the estate of Harper Lee sued a theater producer, alleging that a planned stage adaptation of her beloved novel, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” was unacceptably different from the book.

Next week, that play will open on Broadway, without many of the elements that concerned the estate, but with dramatic changes — a new narrative structure, black characters who express anger and frustration, and a running tension between civility and confrontation — that could make the story resonant for contemporary audiences.

Atticus Finch, the genteel white Alabama lawyer who agrees to defend a black defendant in a rape case, grabs a racist by the hair and threatens to break his arm. Calpurnia, the Finch family cook, questions why prison guards shoot so many times when that defendant tries to flee. And Tom Robinson, the man on trial, gives voice to the racial inequity that has always been at the heart of the story, saying to Atticus in a new jailhouse scene, “I was guilty as soon as I was accused.”

The play’s fidelity to the 1960 novel has been a matter of public controversy since the Lee estate sued in March. Shortly before she died, the novelist had authorized a leading contemporary screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, to write the adaptation, but after her death a draft script alarmed the lawyer who represents the estate.
