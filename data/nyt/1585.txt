The Wisconsin Assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican, said the quiet part out loud this week when he told reporters that it was a blatant power grab for his lame duck chamber to pass legislation that weakens the incoming Democratic governor, Tony Evers.

“We did have an election,” Mr. Vos said on Tuesday. “Whether everyone here likes it or not, I respect the fact that Tony Evers is the governor and he’s going to be starting on Jan. 7. But he’s not the governor today, and that’s why we’re going to make sure the powers of each branch are as equal as they can be.”

Unless they acted, Mr. Vos warned, “we are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in.”

Mr. Evers, that “very liberal governor,” w on the election with 29,227 more votes than the incumbent, Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, so more Wisconsinites seem to believe in his policies than in those of the departing governor. Mr. Evers, the state schools superintendent, ran on an agenda that included increased school spending, a middle-class tax cut and a more humane stance on undocumented immigrants.
