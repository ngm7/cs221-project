Some of the charges included in the seven indictments announced on Wednesday were linked to violent infighting among the Mac Balla Bloods and a slashing attack on a member of a rival gang, the Trinitarios, that left an eight-inch facial gash.

Investigators said they were also able to thwart an attempted killing in Harlem that stemmed from an affront against the mother of a jailed gang member.

On the afternoon of June 29, detectives monitoring a wiretap recorded a conversation about buying a firearm. Plainclothes officers trailed two men, who according to the wiretap were unnerved by the presence of a Police Department patrol car and decided against the vendetta attack. Investigators later arrested the pair and recovered a loaded .357-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, court documents show.

The two were indicted on charges of conspiracy, attempted murder and assault.

The gang also used social media to target victims, instructing a woman to interact online with men and women who conspicuously displayed valuable jewelry on Instagram, according to the indictments. Two gang members were documented discussing plans to lure potential victims to hotels and restaurants where they could be robbed.

Wednesday’s indictments follow other recent large-scale efforts to dismantle the Mac Balla Bloods’ criminal enterprises.

Earlier this year, the United States attorney in Brooklyn filed drug conspiracy charges against 12 people suspected of being Mac Balla members who were accused of selling crack and heroin in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Maine. In 2014, more than 60 people suspected of being Mac Balla Bloods were charged by the Bronx district attorney’s office with murder, kidnapping, drug distribution, weapons possession, assault and home-invasion robberies.
