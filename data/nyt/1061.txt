When it comes to Albany, every labored step out of the ethical muck is something to celebrate.

For this reason, it was a relief on Thursday that a committee set up to determine lawmakers’ pay enacted reforms limiting outside income and eliminating most committee stipends, known as “lulus,” alongside a salary increase.

The pay committee, born out of a wily measure tucked into the state budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers earlier this year, was designed to grant the legislators a hefty raise with no questions asked.

Instead, the committee, made up of four well-regarded current and former public servants — the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer; the former city comptroller, William Thompson Jr.; the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli; and the former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall — acted responsibly.

Per the panel’s unanimous decision on Thursday, state lawmakers, by 2021, will see their pay increase to $130,000, from $79,500 now. But since this essentially acknowledges that legislators are doing a full-time job, their income from other sources will be limited to 15 percent of that salary — $19,500. Stipends will be eliminated for all but the highest-level positions, preventing legislative leaders from handing them out or pulling them back as rewards and punishments. The final details of the committee’s decision are expected to be released in a report on Monday.
