A Manhattan science teacher by trade, Jonas De Leon is a pilot at heart.

This fall he even began teaching some of his students about aviation at Gregorio Luperon High School for Science and Mathematics, work that was featured in a PBS report on Friday.

Just two days later, Mr. De Leonâ€™s skills as a pilot were put to a terrifying real-life test: The plane he was flying on Sunday made an emergency landing on the ninth hole of a golf course in Paramus, N.J.

Of the four people on the plane when it landed, three sustained minor injuries, Sgt. Michael Pollaro of the Paramus Police Department said.
