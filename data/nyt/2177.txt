In the music industry, everybody knows that Meek Mill has the top album this week. But for the time being, at least, the rapper can’t say he has Billboard’s No. 1.

The reason? A delay in the release of the magazine’s weekly chart after a problem last week that may have resulted in the wrong album being named No. 1.

Mill’s latest release, “Championships” (Maybach/Atlantic), is clearly the biggest album in the country, with sales well above those of the second most popular title, “Street Gossip” (Quality Control/Capitol) by Lil Baby. According to charts compiled by a competing company, BuzzAngle, “Championships” had the equivalent of 179,000 sales last week — a figure that includes streams as well as sales of the full album — while “Street Gossip” had just 75,000.

Yet Billboard and Nielsen, which supplies the data for Billboard’s charts, are late this week in reporting data, causing Mill and his team to mute the usual celebratory tweets and news releases. Usually, Billboard publishes the Top 10 albums on its website each Sunday, and on Monday Nielsen’s subscribers can see the data behind Billboard’s full chart of 200 albums.
