Twenty-seven shots — almost two full magazines. That is how many times Officer Juan Gomez fired his pistol on Dec. 5 as he sprinted down a crowded Bronx street, chasing an armed man who had shot at him.

The bullets struck the sidewalk. They struck parked cars. They gouged holes in the brick walls of the apartment buildings on Loring Place North, in the University Heights neighborhood. Fragments from one bullet tore into the leg of a 12-year-old girl. Another bullet hit Irene Ureña Perez, 46, in the belly as she walked a small child home.

“I was leaving the building and heard the shots, tan tan tan tan tan!” said Ms. Perez, who was released from the hospital last week after three operations but remains on bed rest and will probably need more surgery. “I came to this country to work, and now I’m disabled.”

Officer Gomez managed to wound the fleeing gunman in the neck and one foot, stopping him. It was only luck the wild shootout did not lead to the death of bystanders.
