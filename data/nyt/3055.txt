MONTCLAIR, N.J. — Even though Gandini Juggling owes much to many other artists, this British group’s work feels like a whole new genre. Here, juggling becomes flights of inspired poetry, musical choreography with strong dance elements, crazy-comedy surrealism, breathtakingly dexterous virtuosity, darkly absurdist drama. Gandini opens windows in the mind.

I discovered this troupe in 2016, when it played a vital part in Phelim McDermott’s spellbinding English National Opera production of Philip Glass’s “Akhnaten,” which is coming to the Metropolitan Opera next year. Why didn’t I know of Gandini before?

Gandini Juggling was founded in 1992 by Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala “to filter juggling through a dance aesthetic.” With “Smashed” (2010), an enchanting — and dumbfounding — hourlong production, the troupe makes its American debut, in the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University.

Mr. Gandini, the troupe’s director, and Ms. Ylä-Hokkala, the assistant director, are among the nine “Smashed” performers (seven men, two women). Mr. Gandini has said that the death of Pina Bausch, in 2009, inspired this show; and yes, Bauschian elements proliferate here from first to last. Yet the larger mind-set in this show, with its love of rhythmic subtlety and geometric intricacy, is entirely un-Bauschian. The Gandini directors are also said to be fans of Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown; I hope we get to see Gandini works inspired by those two.
