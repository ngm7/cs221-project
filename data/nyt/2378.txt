To the Editor:

In “Social Security Hits a Troubling Financial Milestone” (The New Old Age, Science Times, Nov. 27), you report that think tanks and members of Congress are researching and exploring all sorts of fixes for the program. Bipartisan reforms already exist.

In 2016, a commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center released a comprehensive plan that closes Social Security’s funding gap with an even combination of a gradual increase in taxes and slowing the growth of benefits. The recommendations update the program to align with the 21st-century reality of dual-earner households and protect those most dependent on the program with a more robust minimum benefit.

These improvements, along with a modest increase in payroll taxes, a gradual increase in the full retirement age and several other adjustments to the benefit formula, would both solve the program’s financing challenge and reduce poverty among the elderly.

The problem is that significant but achievable solutions like this one will soon be inadequate. The longer Washington kicks the can down the road, the more difficult it will be to prevent harm to those most dependent on Social Security.
