So in August 2015, her mother decided to send a letter about the plaques to Hudson’s Bay, the Canadian retailer that had acquired Lord & Taylor in 2012.

“My daughter and I had been shopping for hours, taking advantage of the sales,” she began. “It was Memorial Day, and not even one flower was placed there to honor them. They were completely forgotten. The sale was the thing. It was shameful. I want these honor rolls moved to a prominent location, perhaps near the first floor elevator bank. If there is no wall space — then build one.”

Mrs. Robinson told her daughter to print it and send it.

“I didn’t,” she said.

By then, her mother was frail — she had cancer. Every so often, she would ask about the letter to Hudson’s Bay. “I didn’t have the heart to tell her I didn’t do it,” Ms. Robinson explained. More than once, she simply said she had not received a reply.

If Mrs. Robinson saw through her daughter’s prevaricating, she did not let on.

Just before Christmas, the daughter went through Lord & Taylor for a last look at the plaques. There was also some reminiscing about shopping trips with her mother and about how shopping has changed. Why go to stores these days, anyway?

It did not help that Lord & Taylor had aged, maybe too gracefully. It lacked the trendsetting appeal of, say, Bloomingdale’s in the 1970s and 1980s. Lord & Taylor “was the last of the stores that didn’t have loud music,” Ms. Robinson said. “It wasn’t blaring noise. It wasn’t so hipster.”

Lord & Taylor had long since dropped its everything-under-one-roof strategy, and departments like the cut-flower and plant section and the piano section disappeared. But some throwbacks remained. Ms. Robinson remembered Lord & Taylor’s coat check, and she remembered checking more than a coat.
