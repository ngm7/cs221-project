MS. LYNCH Boston has changed dramatically, actually. A lot had to do with politics in so many ways. When I started cooking, I was 22, 23. I opened eight restaurants within 10 years, which is insane, but it was doable back then.

And doable because Boston was missing things I wanted, like an oyster bar in every neighborhood, or a butcher shop in every neighborhood. And so I did it.

What I love about cities in general is community, team-building, and building a culture and a story. And I have to say this is my second time in New Orleans and I love it. Because what I like about it is the same thing as Boston. I think that the pride of my community, which was South Boston, got me to where I am. And I’m not only going to just pin that to South Boston; I’m going to say that the community of chefs in general and restaurateurs brought me to where I am now.
