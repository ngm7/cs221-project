LIFE OF THE PARTY (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO. Melissa McCarthy wowed critics this fall as the lead in the biographical drama “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” But before that, she starred in this lukewarm comedy directed by her husband, Ben Falcone. As Deanna, a middle-aged, newly divorced mother, McCarthy goes back to college after her husband (Matt Walsh) leaves her for another woman. Despite her newfound confidence and a clique of supportive sorority sisters, Deanna’s escapades are mostly forgettable (save for a wild time in the stacks.) Compared to McCarthy’s previous films, the zaniness in “Life of the Party” is kept to a minimum, A. O. Scott wrote in his review: “What we witness is less the explosion of pent-up energy than the gentle affirmation of exuberant kindness.” Watch not for gut-wrenching laughs, but to see McCarthy in a comedic role that isn’t a rowdy sidekick.
