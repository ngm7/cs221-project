Before reading the article:

Take a look at this slide show of photographs of the indigenous Sami people who live in the northern reaches of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia, many of whom are reindeer herders. Then respond to the questions below:

• Based on these pictures and their captions, what inferences can you make about the Sami way of life?

• What do you see that makes you say that?

• What questions do these photos raise for you about these people and their lives?

Now, read the article, “Where Reindeer Are a Way of Life,” and answer the following questions:



1. Why does the author describe herding reindeer as “not a job” but “a way of life” for the Sami people?

2. Why did Jovsset Ante Sara take the Norwegian government to court?

3. The article says that Mr. Sara’s case is just one of many battles the Sami of Norway have fought with the government to preserve their culture and way of life. What other conflicts have the Sami had with the Norwegian government?
