Louis C.K., a comedian who for decades has pushed boundaries onstage, mocked the political activism of Parkland, Fla., school shooting survivors in a recent appearance at a comedy club, the audio of which was posted on YouTube over the weekend.

He has been on the comeback trail for several months after publicly admitting more than a year ago to sexual misconduct with multiple women.

The bit, part of an almost 50-minute set, started with Louis C.K. discussing his disappointment with members of “the younger generation” and what he perceived to be their sensitivities about certain topics, like pronouns.

“They’re like royalty,” he said. “They tell you what to call them. ‘You should address me as “they-them.” Because I identify as gender neutral.’ Oh, O.K. O.K. You should address me as ‘there.’ Because I identify as a location.”
