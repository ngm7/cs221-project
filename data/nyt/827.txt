In a former life as a pastry chef, I baked many elaborate things on a daily basis: hand-pulled Austrian strudel dough, sheet cakes seven-layers tall to be cut into painfully precise 1-inch squares and, of course, cookies.

While cookies in and of themselves weren’t the most challenging thing I made on a daily basis, it was a different story around the holidays. People came to expect something dramatic and festive, code for “overly complicated.”

It was a similar story when I became an editor at a food magazine. Holiday cookies were expected to scream “special.” This was good for newsstands and “social engagement,” but I can tell you who it wasn’t good for: anyone who didn’t consider themselves an especially gifted baker — or anyone who had, you know, other things to do in December. I’ve been complicit in this, creating more than a few cookie recipes that I look at now and think, “Yeah, I’m not gonna do that.” But ever since my work kitchen became my actual kitchen and the oven in my (otherwise wonderful) apartment barely fits a sheet tray, I’ve become more realistic about what I’m willing to do when it comes to “festive” and “special.”
