Josh Allen hasn’t had the greatest of rookie seasons for the Buffalo Bills, with most of his statistics at quarterback ranking near the bottom of the league.

But say this for Allen: He’s willing to air it out.

Allen leads the N.F.L in “intended air yards,” according to the league’s Next Gen stats, which are collected through chips on every player and the ball. The statistic measures how far each pass travels; any yards the receiver gains if he catches it are not counted. When Allen fires the ball, it goes an average of 11.6 yards downfield, the top figure in the league.

Allen ranks ahead of the Tampa Bay tandem of Jameis Winston (10.8) and Ryan Fitzpatrick (10.2). Baker Mayfield of Cleveland and Sam Darnold of the Jets round out the top five at 9.1 each.

These players have something else in common: Their teams, with the possible exception of the Browns, are not very good.
