They endured wildfires and survived Category 4 hurricane winds. They fled gunmen in their high schools and prepared the dead for burial after a massacre inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. They broke barriers at a formerly all-male military academy. They brought political change to Utah and Minnesota and brought hay to fire-torn ranches in Oklahoma.

In a chaotic year of natural disasters, mass shootings and political upheaval, these 18 people left indelible impressions on both our readers and journalists. These newsmakers — whether they sought media attention or a spotlight was cast on them because of a news event — are among the most memorable people we met in 2018.

‘The Best Therapy’

I met Brooke Harrison a few days after a gunman turned her freshman English class into a killing field. Classes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were resuming, and Brooke and her mother, Denise, allowed me to follow them through that first tremulous day back.

Brooke is a sophomore now. She still lives in — and loves — Parkland. Though she was not among the students who immediately became activists, she has recently written op-ed pieces about school safety and gun laws, and in October she spoke at a Democratic Party event in Colorado. In one of her speeches, she explained why she is now so outspoken: “I’ve told anyone I can my story. For me, talking about it, sharing it, waking people up, has been the best therapy.”
