Hey there, everybody!

We kicked off this week with a story nearly as big as Alaska: how the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress and Alaskan officials are rapidly clearing a path for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in that state, even though most Americans oppose drilling there. Written by Henry Fountain and Steve Eder, with wonderful photos from Katie Orlinsky and Brian Adams, it’s a must-read.

But if you just don’t have the time (and if that’s the case, let’s talk about your priorities), Henry and Steve provided a set of quick takeaways from the project. You can also read their interview with a polar bear expert.

By the way, the Trump administration’s push to open up drilling — and to roll back the environmental regulations that can restrict it — is also in the news off the Atlantic coast of the United States, where the administration has approved seismic testing as a prelude to drilling. That could endanger marine life and coastal tourism, and you can expect any attempt to drill to be fiercely opposed by coastal states and environmental groups.
