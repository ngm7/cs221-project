THURSDAY PUZZLE — I am a subversive from way back, despite my outward appearance, so I love any reason to break the rules. It’s even more appealing to me when constructors do it right in their puzzles, for all to see.

Crossword constructors work their magic under an unimaginable list of constraints, and one of them is that all entries in the puzzle must have at least three letters. This was one of many rules created by the first New York Times Crossword editor, Margaret Farrar, who established a standard for making these puzzles more aesthetically pleasing.

But where there is a rule, there is a rule breaker, and Ruth Bloomfield Margolin returns to describe one of the rules and then merrily dash it to pieces. It’s hard to see at first, but then it sneaks up on you and smacks you in the head.

Just the way I like them.

Tricky Clues

I had a tough time diving into these clues; many were not in what I could have sworn were my wheelhouses. Maybe because some of them have newer clues, like EDAM, which I am used to seeing with a clue having to do with its red rind. Today, it was clued as “Big cheese?” Maybe it’s the lower caffeine coffee I’ve been drinking.
