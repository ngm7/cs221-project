To the Editor:

“The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s,” by Margaret O’Mara (Op-Ed, Dec. 6), points to several critical moments in the development of American privacy laws, but there is much in this history that needs clarifying if the next steps on privacy are smart ones.

Ms. O’Mara is correct t hat the proposal for a National Data Center and growing concern about the misuse of personal data by the government culminated in the Privacy Act of 1974 . But a deal with the Ford White House stripped the final bill of private-sector coverage and a dedicated federal agency. The country has lived with the consequences.

Coverage in the private sector is uneven or exists not at all. The absence of a privacy agency is still a gaping hole in American law. The Europeans, building on the United States’ experience and facing similar challenges, managed to develop a privacy regime that is both more coherent and more effective.

Back then, Congress well understood the need to limit the collection of personal data. And Congress did not view privacy protection and the free flow of information as a trade-off. In the same year that Congress enacted the Privacy Act, it also strengthened the Freedom of Information Act.
