Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• The Donald J. Trump Foundation, once billed as the charitable arm of the president’s financial empire, has agreed to dissolve and give away its assets under court supervision. New York’s attorney general accused it of “a shocking pattern of illegality,” including coordination with Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.

• The sentencing of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, was postponed after the judge expressed “disgust” at Mr. Flynn’s efforts to mislead federal investigators.

• In a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate approved the most substantial changes in a generation to federal prison and sentencing laws. House leaders have promised to pass the legislation this week, and President Trump is expected to sign it.
