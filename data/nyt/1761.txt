Canada has found itself caught in the middle of an evolving power play between the United States and China. On Saturday, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver for a flight to Mexico.

On Friday in a Vancouver courtroom, the fraud allegations by the United States against Ms. Meng began to emerge in what may be a long extradition hearing. (It was also disclosed that Ms. Meng owns two houses in Vancouver and spends two to three weeks there each year.)

The arrest has already provoked vitriol and fear in China toward both the United States and Canada. Ms. Meng is not just a top executive at a company that is a source of pride for China, she is also the daughter of Huawei’s founder.

We have a team of reporters and editors around the world following the consequences of Ms. Meng’s arrest. If the story has captured your interest, make The Times your destination for news and analysis on further developments.
