Charles Barkley is not 6-foot-6. LeBron James almost assuredly does not weigh 250 pounds. And Buddy Hield was not born in 1993.

Proving once again that you can’t necessarily trust the biographical information published about N.B.A. players, Hield, a breakout star for the Sacramento Kings, revealed this week that he is a year older than nearly everyone had assumed. The trick, however, is that he said he never told anyone the wrong age.

The situation arose on Monday night, with Hield celebrating his birthday as his team lost handily to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Before the game, Hield told the Kings’ broadcast team that he was turning 26, which threw many people for a loop, as NBA.com and nearly every media outlet have his birth date listed as Dec. 17, 1993, which would have made him 25.

As of 10 p.m. on Thursday, that was still the case in terms of NBA.com, Basketball-Reference.com and other major websites.
