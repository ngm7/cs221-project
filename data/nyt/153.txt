In explaining the Mets’ hiring of Brodie Van Wagenen as their new general manager, Jeff Wilpon, the team’s chief operating officer and one of its owners, said the new architect was creative and aggressive. A month into the job, Van Wagenen appeared close to making a risky, bold trade on Friday that would signal the Mets’ expectation of contending for a playoff spot next season.

Seeking a veteran hitter and a proven reliever after a second consecutive losing season, the Mets were inching toward acquiring Robinson Cano, the aging star second baseman, and Edwin Diaz, a young standout closer, from the rebuilding Seattle Mariners, according to multiple people familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly because the trade was not final. They said the Mariners would receive two prospects who were first-round draft picks and two underperforming veteran players.

A framework of the trade was in place Friday, but, if completed, it might not be announced until next week because of remaining hurdles, like the medical reviews and money changing hands.

The trade was complicated partly because of money owed to Cano, an eight-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Mariners five years ago. Van Wagenen, a former agent, helped negotiate the deal.
