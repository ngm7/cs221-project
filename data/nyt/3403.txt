Just seven months before the scheduled release of a new technology system intended to simplify the repayment process for more than 35 million federal student loan borrowers, the Education Department is scrapping its plan and starting over.

The government is the primary lender for students who borrow for college, but it relies on eight outside contractors to service its $1.3 trillion portfolio. Those companies send out monthly bills, collect payments and guide former students through a repayment process that can take decades.

All of the servicers’ contracts expire next year. The Education Department planned to use that opportunity for an overhaul that would replace its fragmented system with a more streamlined one.

The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, described the agency’s vision last year and called for proposals from vendors. In September, the department named the companies that would advance to the next round of bidding.
