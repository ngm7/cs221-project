The word foible has appeared in 59 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 15 in “George R. R. Martin, Fantasy’s Reigning King” by Charles Yu:

Throughout the books, Martin depicts a society simple enough to understand but complex enough in its dynamics to be a model and mirror of our own. His output, in fact, seems calibrated to optimize depth and breadth. “We know not only what characters think and feel, but what they eat, wear, see and smell — even the sex of their horses,” says Anne Groell, who has been Martin’s editor at Bantam Books for two decades. “George’s characters feel like people because they are people, with all the foibles and doubts and internal contradictions that every one of us contain. We can relate to these characters because we are these characters.”
