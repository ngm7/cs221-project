This dark take on the long-running Archie Comics series — or a “hotter and more haunted” twist, according to James Poniewozik of The New York Times — has captivated audiences with its nostalgia-inducing settings and character archetypes.

Meanwhile, Betty (Lili Reinhart) edges closer to discovering the truth behind Griffins & Gargoyles, a “Riverdale” version of Dungeons & Dragons that involves real poison.
