When four people sued President Trump and the Trump Organization, accusing them of using the Trump name to entice vulnerable investors to enter sham business schemes, the plaintiffs took the highly unusual step of asking a judge for permission to proceed under pseudonyms.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who are listed in the lawsuit with names like Jane Doe and Richard Roe, said in court papers that their clients feared retaliation if their names became public. The lawyers cited Mr. Trump’s “history of wielding his wealth, stature and Twitter account to attack people whom he perceives to be his enemies,” including people who sue him.

On Thursday, the judge, Lorna G. Schofield of Federal District Court in Manhattan, agreed with them, ruling that the plaintiffs could keep their names concealed for now, as their lawsuit moved forward.

“The manner in which the president has used his position and platform to affect the course of pending court cases,” Judge Schofield said, “is really without precedent.”
