Samantha Bee hosted a charity Christmas special on Wednesday, installing an ice rink in her studio and calling the show “Christmas on I.C.E.,” a reference to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Bee turned her show into a fund-raiser for Kids in Need of Defense, an organization that provides legal representation to immigrant children. And she referred to the team of figure skaters circling the ice as “the Abolish I.C.E. Skaters.”

As part of the special, Bee aired a segment for which she traveled to McAllen, Tex., a border town sometimes referred to as a modern-day Ellis Island. There she met Elizabeth Cavazos, a volunteer with Angry Tias and Abuelas, which assists asylum-seekers in McAllen.

“We’re the first smiling faces they see when they get here, and I just want them to know that I’m so stoked that they’re here,” Cavazos said.

The Punchiest Punchlines (Border Edition)

“According to CNN, President Trump is leading the push for a full and rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. Apparently he just found out that Syria does not share a border with Mexico.” — SETH MEYERS “Trump was threatening to shut down the government if Congress didn’t give him $5 billion for a border wall, but now he says that he’ll get the money somewhere else. Or as one guy in Moscow put it, ‘Ugh, I’ll get my checkbook. But this counts for birthday and Christmas!’” — JIMMY FALLON
