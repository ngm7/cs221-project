LONDON — “Museums. Ugh,” said Amy Cappellazzo, the chairman and executive vice president of Sotheby’s, having been told of the German artist Gerhard Richter’s long-held desire for his paintings to acquired by public galleries, rather than private collectors. “That’s a very socialist, democratic way of having to deal with, like, rich people who want them,” added Ms. Cappellazzo. A forthcoming Sotheby’s auction included abstracts by Mr. Richter valued at $20 million to $30 million each.

This is a moment in “The Price of Everything,” a documentary which takes us inside the finance-crazed alternative reality of the international art world. Scrupulously nonjudgmental in approach, the movie, directed by Nathaniel Kahn, stars some of the market’s most influential artists, collectors, critics and dealmakers.

We meet Jeff Koons in his high-tech studio, surrounded by assistants making his old master-inspired “Gazing Ball” paintings. We see the feted Nigerian-American artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby watching online as one of her paintings is bid to $900,000 at auction. We’re invited into the apartment of Stefan Edlis, the collector who gifted $500 million of contemporary masterworks to the Art Institute of Chicago. We watch George Condo, whose art is also priced in the millions — painting — and repainting — a canvas before lunch.
