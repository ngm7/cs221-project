But the dual subject matter of “The Last Resort” is strong enough to withstand this. The cultural transformation and re-transformation of Miami Beach (specifically its southern tip, South Beach) is a story that’s fascinating, poignant, garish and, in some ways, befuddling. From a near-frontier in the 1910s, it became a counter-counterculture showbiz enclave in the ’60s. This led to a population influx of mostly Jewish retirees, which made the place, for a time, a borscht belt below the Mason-Dixon line.

The photographer Andy Sweet told a part of this story in the ’70s. He shot casually composed candid stills, in saturated color, of older South Beach residents, many of them Holocaust survivors, enjoying a kind of paradise regained, replete with palm trees and balmy weather.
