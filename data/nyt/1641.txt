Stills, though, showed terrific awareness of the field, turning and lateraling the ball to DeVante Parker, who carried it just a bit before pitching the ball to Kenyan Drake.

The play still seemed likely to end in failure, but Drake, a running back, broke a tackle, cut left, got a tremendous block to give him some room, and then cut back to his right and streaked down the sideline and into the end zone. He easily outran Rob Gronkowski, the Patriots’ tight end who had been in on defense to help in deep pass coverage.

The play also harked back to the Dolphins’ past, when running back Tony Nathan took a lateral from receiver Duriel Harris and ran 25 yards for a touchdown at the end of the first half of the Epic in Miami divisional playoff game against the San Diego Chargers in the 1981 season. The Chargers won that one in overtime, however.

“Those guys executed it as well as you could,” Dolphins Coach Adam Gase said of Drake’s touchdown. “When you practice it, you don’t really know how it’s going to turn out. Kenyan realized he had a lane and took it.”
