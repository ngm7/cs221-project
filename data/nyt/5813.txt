Susan Orlean, the New Yorker writer and book author, is currently on a five-month, North American zigzag to promote “The Library Book,” her newest best-seller. And in between speaking engagements — while she is idling in hotels or awaiting delayed flights — she is teaching herself to play the ukulele, strumming under the tutelage of YouTube videos and ukulele apps. Her repertoire already includes the Grateful Dead’s “Uncle John’s Band” and “Ho Hey,” by The Lumineers. “I’m not a great relaxer,” she said over breakfast in a midtown Manhattan hotel on a late November morning, dismantling the impressive heap of pancakes that had been placed in front of her.

“The Library Book” weaves together the stories of the 1986 arson fire of the Los Angeles Library, the history of libraries and Ms. Orlean’s personal connection to these institutions. Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Michael Lewis wrote, “Susan Orlean has once again found rich material where no one else has bothered to look for it.” Ms. Orlean is also the author of “Rin Tin Tin,” a biography of the canine movie star, and “The Orchid Thief.”

As Ms. Orlean travels to cities like Seattle and Dallas, she has shared on her Twitter feed (309,000 followers at last count) the highs and lows of months spent on the road. “Exit row with no one in the middle seat. In a past life I must have done something good,” she wrote one day. “Lemme tell you, book tours aren’t for sissies,” she wrote two days before.

Over an unhurried breakfast, Ms. Orlean , who, when she is not on the road, lives in Los Angeles with her husband, John Gillespie, and their son, discussed her travel strategies for doing laundry, staying calm during takeoff and the “transformational” foot rest she has discovered.
