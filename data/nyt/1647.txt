The real talk among moneyed collectors was the impact of a skidding stock market coupled with a dramatic cooling of luxury real-estate values around South Florida. While the inaugural Faena Festival was unspooling around Miami Beach’s art-themed Faena House condo building, another story was unfolding inside the three-year-old Faena House itself. The shift in market outlook had produced what The Wall Street Journal called an “exodus” of high-end condo owners (including the gallerist Larry Gagosian), who were selling off their units there, many for millions of dollars less than their purchase prices. Local Realtors have been loudly forecasting that Miami real-estate prices were poised to hit new heights, buoyed by Basel’s annual presence. Their high-net-worth clients seemed to be betting otherwise.

A similar warning was contained within an otherwise glowing new analysis commissioned by the Miami-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and conducted by the consulting firm TDC. “Evolving Arts Ecosystems: A Study of Miami” took a broad look at the undeniable “explosion” of cultural activity over the past decade in the wake of Art Basel’s arrival, much of it spurred by the $165 million in grants that Knight has given since 2005 to local arts organizations, ranging from institutions like the Pérez Art Museum Miami to scrappy artist-run spots like Swampspace and the Bas Fisher Invitational. (Letter16 Press, a nonprofit publisher of photography books co-founded by this reporter, is also a past Knight grant recipient.) Attendance records at museums have shattered even the most optimistic projections; arts-related jobs continue to sprout; a once-endemic “brain drain” has been, if not reversed, at least stabilized.
