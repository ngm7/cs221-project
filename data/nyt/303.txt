In her recipe, the bread crumbs are stirred into the topping, but some cooks prefer to sprinkle them on after saucing the dough. The choice is yours. As for cheeses, consider caciocavallo or provolone, coarsely grated. But you’ll also get good result with more widely available pecorino Romano.

As the sfincione bakes, your kitchen will fill with tantalizing aromas. Inhale deeply and dream of Sicily. I’m told sfincione is popular there for Christmas Eve and New Year’s celebrations. In my view, it’s an any-time-of-year delight.

And to Drink …

Pizza is nothing to agonize about. It’s hard to go wrong unless you overthink it. Reflexive choices like barberas from the Piedmont region of Italy or Chiantis are just fine. Any Italian red with plenty of acidity will go great, as will lager beer. But if you would like to refine your choice, bubbles are the way to go. Good, dry, earthy Lambrusco with pizza is wonderful. So are some of the lesser-known red sparkling wines from Italy, like Gragnano from Campania or Gutturnio from Emilia-Romagna. If you want to push it, try a good nonvintage Champagne. Or go all out with a well-aged Barolo or Barbaresco. Pizza may be considered simple food, but it goes beautifully with some of the finest wines in the world. ERIC ASIMOV
