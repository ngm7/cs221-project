The story of President Trump’s involvement in hush payments to a porn star and a former Playboy model in 2016 is once again in the spotlight. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law and prosecutors say Trump directed the illegal payments. What does this mean for Trump? No one knows yet. Here’s what we do know. Did Trump know about the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal? Yes. Trump initially pleaded ignorance. Reporter: “Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” “No.” But prosecutors say the evidence shows that he was aware of both cases. Cohen’s lawyer released a secretly recorded conversation between Cohen and Trump that seemed to be about the McDougal payments. Trump: “Listen. What financing?” Cohen: “We’ll have to pay —” Trump: “Pay with cash —” Cohen: “No — no, no, no, no, no, no — I got — no, no, no.” What was the motivation for the payments? Prosecutors say, to hide a potential sex scandal. Both women were paid off in the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump claimed he made the payments for personal reasons, tweeting that it was a simple private transaction. But prosecutors say Cohen admitted that Trump directed him to make the payments to bury accusations Trump feared could jeopardize his candidacy. Why does the motivation matter? It will determine if it’s a campaign finance violation. Prosecutors say that by suppressing the stories, Cohen and Trump deceived voters and tainted the election process, which is breaking campaign finance law. So, what comes next? Unclear. On Dec. 12, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for multiple crimes. The Justice Department has decided it can’t prosecute a sitting president. But if Trump loses re-election, it’s possible prosecutors could try and charge him in 2021.
