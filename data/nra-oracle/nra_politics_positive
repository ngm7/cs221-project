When the National Rifle Association talks, large swaths of Capitol Hill listen.

And when the NRA has aimed to block any new gun legislation in the wake of mass shootings, it's so far succeeded in thwarting such efforts.
So why does the group hold such sway?
Partly because more than half of congressional incumbents have gotten money and organizational help from the group, with many members having long-standing financial relationships with the NRA that date back years.

According to federal election data compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, eight lawmakers have been on the receiving end of at least $1 million in campaign contributions from the NRA over the courses of their careers
While large industries such as defense, health care and finance give more to federal candidates, so-called "single-issue" groups have always been a bit different. For them, it's not necessarily as much about outspending and outflanking other industry powers as it is how they compare with the other side -- those advocating the opposite position.
By that measure, the NRA and its allies aren't just winning, they've been dominating for years.
In the 2018 election cycle so far, gun rights groups, including the NRA, have outspent the competition more than 40 to 1.
Gun rights groups have made nearly $600,000 in direct contributions and independent expenditures on behalf of congressional candidates, the data shows. Gun control groups? Barely $14,000.
